User Story Title: As a business user, I want to view the execution history of my scheduled reports, so that I can track delivery and troubleshoot issues.

User Story Description: This feature provides users with a log/history of all automated report executions, including timestamps, delivery status (success/failure), and error messages if any. Users can filter by date, status, and report type.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Users can access a history page for scheduled report executions.
2. Each entry shows report name, scheduled time, actual execution time, status, and recipient list.
3. Users can filter and sort the history by date, status, and report type.
4. Failed deliveries display error details and suggested actions.

Validations:
1. Only the owner or authorized users can view the execution history.
2. All log entries must be accurate and up-to-date.
3. Error messages must be clear and actionable.

Business Logic:
- Each scheduled execution logs a record in the database with status and metadata.
- On failure, the system captures the error and notifies the user.
- Users can export the history as CSV or PDF for audit purposes.

Technical Context:
- Technology stack: .NET Core backend, Angular frontend, Azure SQL Database.
- API endpoints for fetching and filtering execution logs.
- Security: Role-based access, encrypted log storage.

Non-Functional Requirements:
- Performance: History page must load within 3 seconds for up to 1,000 records.
- Security: Only authorized access to logs.
- Auditability: All access to logs is tracked.
- Monitoring: Alerts for repeated failures or unusual activity.

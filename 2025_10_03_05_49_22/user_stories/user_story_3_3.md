User Story Title: As a passenger, I want to manage my profile and travel preferences, so that I can have a personalized booking experience.

User Story Description: This feature allows passengers to create and update their profiles, including personal details, frequent flyer information, travel preferences (meal, seat, etc.), and saved payment methods. The system should use these preferences to pre-fill booking forms and suggest relevant flights and services.

Business Logic: When a passenger logs in, retrieve profile and preferences to customize the booking flow. Update preferences in real-time and ensure they are used in all relevant system interactions.

Technical Context: Tech stack: .NET Core backend, React frontend, encrypted database storage for sensitive data, REST API for profile management, OAuth2 authentication, secure HTTPS endpoints.

Non-Functional Requirements: Data encryption at rest and in transit, GDPR compliance, 99.9% uptime, response time <1 second for profile actions, audit logging for profile changes.

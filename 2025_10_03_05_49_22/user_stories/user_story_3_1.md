User Story Title: As a passenger, I want to book air transport tickets online, so that I can conveniently plan my travel.

User Story Description: This feature allows passengers to search for available flights, compare prices, and book tickets online. The system should provide options for one-way, round-trip, and multi-city bookings. Passengers should be able to select seats, add baggage, and receive confirmation via email or SMS.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Passengers can search for flights by date, destination, and number of passengers.
2. Passengers can view flight details, prices, and seat availability.
3. Passengers can complete booking and receive confirmation.

Validations:
1. Validate passenger information (name, contact, passport details).
2. Validate payment information and process securely.
3. Validate seat selection and availability before booking.

Business Logic: The booking flow should check real-time seat availability, calculate total fare including taxes and fees, and ensure payment is processed before confirming the booking. If payment fails, booking should not be confirmed.

Technical Context: Tech stack: .NET Core backend, React frontend, REST API for flight data, integration with payment gateway, secure HTTPS endpoints, JSON data format, OAuth2 authentication.

Non-Functional Requirements: System should handle 1000 concurrent users, 99.9% uptime, PCI DSS compliance for payments, response time <2 seconds for search, audit logging for all transactions.

EPIC Number: 3
User Story Number: 1
User Story Title: As a user, I want to perform basic arithmetic operations, So that I can calculate sums, differences, products, and quotients easily.

User Story Description: This user story covers the ability for a user to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) using the calculator application. The user should be able to input two numbers and select the desired operation to get the result.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. The user can input two numbers.
2. The user can select one of the four operations: add, subtract, multiply, divide.
3. The result is displayed after the operation is performed.
4. Division by zero is handled gracefully with an error message.

Validations:
1. Both inputs must be valid numbers.
2. Division by zero must not crash the application and must show a friendly error.
3. Only valid operations are allowed (no unsupported symbols).

Business Logic: 
- Accept two numeric inputs.
- Based on the selected operation, perform the arithmetic calculation.
- If division is selected and the second number is zero, display an error message.
- Display the result to the user.

Technical Context:
- Technology stack: React (frontend), Node.js (backend, if needed)
- No external API needed for core calculation
- Data format: JSON for any backend communication
- Security: Input validation on both frontend and backend

Non-Functional Requirements:
- Response time for calculation must be < 1 second
- Application must be available 99.9% of the time
- Input validation must prevent code injection
- Application should be scalable to support 1000 concurrent users
- Basic analytics on operation usage
- Error logging and monitoring enabled

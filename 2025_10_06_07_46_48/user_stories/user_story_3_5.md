EPIC Number: 3
User Story Number: 5
User Story Title: As a user, I want to receive clear error messages when my calculation cannot be performed, So that I understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

User Story Description: The calculator should provide meaningful, user-friendly error messages for common issues such as invalid input, division by zero, or system errors. Error messages should be displayed prominently and disappear when the issue is resolved.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Error messages are displayed for invalid input, division by zero, and system errors.
2. Error messages are clear, concise, and actionable.
3. Error messages disappear when the issue is resolved.

Validations:
1. Division by zero triggers a specific error message.
2. Invalid input triggers a specific error message.
3. System errors trigger a generic error message.

Business Logic:
- On error, display appropriate message in error area.
- Remove error message when input is corrected or calculation is possible.

Technical Context:
- Technology stack: ReactJS frontend error handling.
- No backend required for error messaging.
- Security: Ensure error messages do not expose sensitive system details.

Non-Functional Requirements:
- Error messages must be accessible and readable.
- Error handling must be robust and not crash the app.
- App must meet accessibility standards for error messaging.

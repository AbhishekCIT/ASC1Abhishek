EPIC Number: 3
User Story Number: 1
User Story Title: As a user, I want to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), So that I can calculate results for simple math problems.

User Story Description: The calculator should allow users to input two numbers and select an arithmetic operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide). Upon pressing the 'Calculate' button, the result should be displayed clearly. The UI should be intuitive and responsive for both desktop and mobile users.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. User can input two numbers.
2. User can select one of the four operations.
3. Calculation is performed correctly and result is displayed.
4. UI is responsive and user-friendly.

Validations:
1. Only numeric input is accepted.
2. Division by zero is prevented and handled gracefully.
3. No empty input fields allowed.

Business Logic: 
- On 'Calculate', validate inputs.
- Perform selected operation using standard arithmetic rules.
- If division by zero, show error message.
- Display result in designated area.

Technical Context:
- Technology stack: ReactJS frontend, NodeJS backend (if needed).
- No external API required for basic operations.
- Data format: JSON for any backend communication.
- Security: Input sanitization and validation on both client and server.

Non-Functional Requirements:
- Calculation should be instant (<0.5s response).
- UI must be available 99.9% uptime.
- Input validation and error handling must be robust.
- App should scale for 1000+ concurrent users.
- Analytics: Track operation usage for future improvements.

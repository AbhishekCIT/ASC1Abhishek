User Story Title: As a passenger, I want to book air transport tickets online, so that I can conveniently plan my travel.

User Story Description: This feature allows passengers to search for available flights, select preferred options, and book tickets online. The system should provide real-time availability, pricing, and booking confirmation. Users should be able to enter passenger details, select seats, and make payments securely.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Passengers can search for flights by date, destination, and origin.
2. The system displays available flights with real-time pricing.
3. Users can select flights, enter details, and complete payment.
4. Booking confirmation is provided instantly via email and on-screen.

Validations:
1. Validate that all mandatory passenger details are provided.
2. Validate payment information before processing.
3. Ensure selected flights are available at booking time.

Business Logic: The system checks flight availability, calculates total price, reserves seats, and processes payment. If payment fails, booking is not confirmed and seats are released. Confirmation triggers an email and ticket generation.

Technical Context: Web application using React (frontend), Node.js/Express (backend), RESTful APIs for flight data, payment gateway integration (e.g., Stripe), secure HTTPS, data stored in PostgreSQL, integration with airline APIs.

Non-Functional Requirements: System must handle 500 concurrent users, respond to search queries within 2 seconds, ensure PCI DSS compliance for payments, 99.9% uptime, and provide monitoring for failed bookings.

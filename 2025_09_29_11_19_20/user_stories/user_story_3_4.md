User Story Title: As a passenger, I want to access customer support and FAQs online, so that I can resolve issues or get information without waiting in line.

User Story Description: This feature provides passengers with access to a comprehensive FAQ section, live chat, and support ticket system. Passengers can search for answers, initiate a chat with support agents, or submit a ticket for more complex issues.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Passengers can search and browse FAQs by keyword and category.
2. Users can initiate live chat with a support agent.
3. Users can submit a support ticket and track its status.
4. System provides automated responses for common queries.

Validations:
1. Validate that support tickets are logged with all required information.
2. Ensure chat and ticket responses are tracked and timestamped.
3. Confirm FAQ content is up-to-date and relevant.

Business Logic: The system indexes FAQ content for search, routes chat requests to available agents, logs support tickets with unique IDs, and provides automated responses for common issues. Escalation rules apply for unresolved tickets.

Technical Context: Web application with React frontend, Node.js backend, integration with third-party chat/ticketing systems (e.g., Zendesk), secure HTTPS, data stored in PostgreSQL, real-time chat via WebSockets.

Non-Functional Requirements: Chat response time under 1 minute, ticket acknowledgment within 2 minutes, system must support 99.9% uptime, and ensure GDPR compliance for user data.

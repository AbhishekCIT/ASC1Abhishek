User Story Title: As a traveler, I want to book air transport tickets online, So that I can conveniently plan and purchase my travel.

User Story Description: This feature allows users to search for available flights, compare prices, select preferred flights, and complete the booking process online. The system should provide real-time availability, pricing, and booking confirmation.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Users can search for flights by origin, destination, and date.
2. Users can view available flights with prices and timings.
3. Users can select a flight and complete the booking with payment.
4. Users receive a booking confirmation and e-ticket via email.

Validations:
1. Origin and destination fields must not be empty.
2. Date must be a valid future date.
3. Payment information must be validated before booking is confirmed.

Business Logic: The system should query airline APIs for real-time availability and pricing. Bookings are confirmed only after successful payment. E-tickets are generated and sent to the user's email address.

Technical Context: The application will use a web frontend (React), backend (Node.js/Express), and integrate with airline APIs (REST/JSON). Payment processing will use a secure payment gateway (PCI DSS compliant). Data is stored in a relational database (PostgreSQL). Security includes HTTPS, authentication, and data encryption.

Non-Functional Requirements: The system must handle 1000+ concurrent users, provide 99.9% uptime, ensure data privacy, scale horizontally, and log all transactions for analytics and monitoring.

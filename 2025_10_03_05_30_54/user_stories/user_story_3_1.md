User Story Title: As a traveler, I want to search for available air transport options, so that I can plan my journey efficiently.

User Story Description: This user story covers the ability for users to search for available flights or air transport options based on their origin, destination, travel dates, and preferences. The system should provide a user-friendly interface for inputting search criteria and display relevant results with key details such as timings, airlines, prices, and layovers.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Users can input origin, destination, and travel dates.
2. Users can filter results by airline, price, and number of stops.
3. Search results display flight details including timings, airline, price, and layovers.
4. System returns results within 3 seconds.
5. Users can sort results by price, duration, or departure time.

Validations:
1. Origin and destination cannot be the same.
2. Travel dates must be in the future.
3. All mandatory fields must be filled before search is enabled.

Business Logic: 
- Query flight database/API with user criteria.
- Filter and sort results as per user selection.
- Exclude flights that are fully booked or unavailable.
- Pseudocode:
  IF origin != destination AND date > today THEN
    FETCH flights WHERE criteria match
    FILTER/SORT as per user input
    RETURN results
  ELSE
    SHOW validation error

Technical Context: 
- Technology stack: ReactJS frontend, Node.js backend, Azure SQL Database, Azure Functions
- Integration with third-party flight APIs (e.g., Amadeus, Sabre)
- REST API endpoints for search
- Data format: JSON
- Security: OAuth2 for user authentication, HTTPS for data transmission

Non-Functional Requirements:
- Response time < 3 seconds for search
- 99.9% uptime for search functionality
- Data encrypted in transit and at rest
- Scalable to handle 10,000 concurrent users
- Logging of search queries for analytics
- Monitoring via Azure Application Insights

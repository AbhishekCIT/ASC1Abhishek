User Story Title: As a traveler, I want to modify or cancel my air transport booking, so that I can manage changes to my travel plans.

User Story Description: This user story covers the ability for users to view, modify, or cancel their existing bookings. The system should allow users to retrieve their booking using a reference number, make changes to passenger details, travel dates, or seats, and process cancellations with applicable refund policies.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Users can retrieve bookings using a unique reference number.
2. Users can modify passenger details, travel dates, or seat selections (subject to airline policy).
3. Users can cancel bookings and view applicable refund amounts.
4. System updates booking status and sends confirmation of changes/cancellation.
5. Refunds are processed as per policy and confirmation sent to user.

Validations:
1. Only future bookings can be modified or cancelled.
2. Changes are subject to airline fare rules and seat availability.
3. Refunds are calculated based on cancellation policy.

Business Logic:
- Retrieve booking details from database.
- Validate requested changes against airline policy.
- Update booking and process refunds if applicable.
- Pseudocode:
  IF booking exists AND date > today THEN
    IF change/cancel request valid per policy THEN
      UPDATE booking
      PROCESS refund if applicable
      SEND confirmation
    ELSE
      SHOW error
  ELSE
    SHOW error

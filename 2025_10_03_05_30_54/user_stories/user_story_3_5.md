User Story Title: As a frequent traveler, I want to manage my profile and view my travel history, so that I can easily access my past and upcoming bookings.

User Story Description: This user story covers the ability for users to create and manage their profiles, store frequent traveler information, and view a history of all past and upcoming air transport bookings. The system should provide a secure interface for updating personal information and displaying booking history with relevant details.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Users can create and update their profile information (name, contact, preferences).
2. Users can view a list of all past and upcoming bookings.
3. Users can access details of each booking from the history.
4. Profile data is securely stored and can be updated at any time.
5. Users can delete their profile and associated data.

Validations:
1. Mandatory fields (name, email) must be provided and valid.
2. Only authenticated users can access or modify their profile and history.
3. Data changes are logged for audit purposes.

Business Logic:
- Store and retrieve user profile and booking history from database.
- Allow updates to profile with validation.
- Link bookings to user account for history display.
- Pseudocode:
  IF user authenticated THEN
    ALLOW profile update
    SHOW booking history
    ALLOW booking detail view
  ELSE
    DENY access

Technical Context:
- Technology stack: ReactJS frontend, Node.js backend, Azure SQL Database
- REST API for profile and history management
- Data format: JSON
- Security: OAuth2 authentication, HTTPS, GDPR compliance

Non-Functional Requirements:
- Profile updates reflected within 2 seconds
- 99.9% uptime for profile/history service
- Data encrypted at rest and in transit
- Scalable to 100,000 user profiles
- Audit logging for all profile changes
- Monitoring for unauthorized access attempts

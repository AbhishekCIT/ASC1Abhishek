User Story Title: As a traveler, I want to book air transport tickets online, So that I can conveniently plan my travel.

User Story Description: This feature will allow users to search for flights, compare options, and book tickets directly through the application. The system should provide real-time availability, pricing, and booking confirmation.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Users can search for flights by origin, destination, and date.
2. Users can view available flights with details (airline, time, price).
3. Users can select and book a flight, receiving a confirmation.

Validations:
1. Origin and destination must be valid airport codes.
2. Date must be in the future.
3. Payment must be successfully processed before confirmation.

Business Logic: The system should query flight APIs, filter results based on user input, and handle booking through secure payment gateways. If a booking fails, the user should be notified and able to retry.

Technical Context: Use REST APIs to integrate with airline systems. Frontend: React.js, Backend: Node.js, Database: PostgreSQL. Payment integration via Stripe. Data exchanged in JSON format. Secure all endpoints with OAuth2.

Non-Functional Requirements: Response time <2 seconds for search, 99.9% availability, PCI DSS compliance for payments, scalable to 10,000 concurrent users, logging and monitoring of all booking transactions.

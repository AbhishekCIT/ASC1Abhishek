EPIC Number: 3
User Story Number: 2
User Story Title: As a user, I want to view a history of my previous calculations, So that I can refer back to past results without recalculating.

User Story Description: This user story covers the ability for users to see a list of their previous calculations within the current session. The history should display the input values, selected operation, and result for each calculation, and allow users to clear the history if desired.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Calculation history is displayed in a list format.
2. Each history entry shows both operands, the operation, and the result.
3. User can clear the entire calculation history.
4. History is session-based and resets when the application is refreshed or closed.

Validations:
1. Only valid calculations are added to the history.
2. Clearing history removes all entries.
3. History does not persist across sessions.

Business Logic: 
- After each successful calculation, append an entry to the history array.
- On clear, empty the history array.

Technical Context: 
- Technology stack: ReactJS frontend (local state or Redux for history)
- No backend persistence required
- Security: Ensure no sensitive data is stored

Non-Functional Requirements:
- Performance: History updates should be instantaneous
- Availability: 99.9% uptime
- Security: No data persistence beyond session
- Scalability: Should support at least 100 concurrent users
- Monitoring: Log history clear events

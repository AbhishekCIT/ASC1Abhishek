EPIC Number: 3
User Story Number: 1
User Story Title: As a user, I want to perform basic arithmetic operations, So that I can calculate results for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

User Story Description: This user story covers the ability for a user to input two numbers and select an arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) to receive the correct result. The calculator should handle both integer and decimal values and display the result clearly.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. User can input two numbers.
2. User can select one of the four operations: add, subtract, multiply, divide.
3. Result is displayed after calculation.
4. Division by zero is handled gracefully with an error message.
5. Supports both integer and decimal input.

Validations:
1. Both input fields must be numeric.
2. Division by zero must not be allowed.
3. Inputs must not be empty before calculation.

Business Logic: 
- Addition: result = number1 + number2
- Subtraction: result = number1 - number2
- Multiplication: result = number1 * number2
- Division: if number2 != 0 then result = number1 / number2 else display error

Technical Context: 
- Technology stack: Web application (ReactJS frontend, Node.js backend)
- API: RESTful API for calculation logic
- Data format: JSON for API communication
- Security: Input validation on both client and server sides

Non-Functional Requirements:
- Performance: Calculation and result display should be near-instantaneous (<1 second)
- Availability: 99.9% uptime
- Security: Input sanitization, no code injection
- Scalability: Should support at least 100 concurrent users
- Monitoring: Log calculation errors and invalid input attempts

User Story Title: As a user, I want to clear all inputs and results, So that I can quickly reset the calculator and start a new calculation.

User Story Description: This user story covers the ability for users to clear all input fields and the displayed result with a single action, making it easier to start a new calculation without manually deleting previous entries.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. There is a clear/reset button visible on the calculator interface.
2. Clicking the clear/reset button empties both input fields and removes the displayed result.
3. The calculator is ready for new input after clearing.

Validations:
1. Clear/reset button is always enabled and visible.
2. All fields and result area are empty after clearing.
3. No residual data remains after clearing.

Business Logic: 
- On clear/reset button click, set input1 = '', input2 = '', result = ''

Technical Context: 
- Technology stack: ReactJS frontend
- No backend interaction required
- Security: No sensitive data involved

Non-Functional Requirements:
- Performance: Clearing should be instantaneous
- Availability: 99.9% uptime
- Security: No data persistence
- Scalability: Should support at least 100 concurrent users
- Monitoring: Log clear/reset button usage

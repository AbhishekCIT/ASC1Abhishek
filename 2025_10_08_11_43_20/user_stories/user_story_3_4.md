EPIC Number: 3
User Story Number: 4
User Story Title: As a user, I want to use keyboard input for calculations, So that I can quickly enter numbers and operations without relying on the mouse.

User Story Description: This user story covers the ability for users to use their keyboard to enter numbers, select operations (using keys like +, -, *, /), and press Enter to calculate the result. This improves accessibility and efficiency for power users.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. User can type numbers directly into the input fields.
2. User can use keyboard keys (+, -, *, /) to select operations.
3. Pressing Enter triggers the calculation.
4. Tab and Shift+Tab navigate between input fields and buttons.

Validations:
1. Only valid keys are accepted for operations.
2. Calculation is only triggered if both inputs are valid.
3. Keyboard shortcuts do not interfere with browser/system shortcuts.

Business Logic: 
- Listen for keypress events on input fields and operation selectors.
- Map keys to corresponding operations and trigger calculation logic on Enter.

Technical Context: 
- Technology stack: ReactJS frontend
- Use event listeners for keyboard events
- Security: Sanitize all keyboard input

Non-Functional Requirements:
- Performance: Keyboard input should be responsive (<50ms delay)
- Availability: 99.9% uptime
- Security: Prevent code injection via keyboard
- Scalability: Should support at least 100 concurrent users
- Monitoring: Log keyboard-triggered calculation attempts

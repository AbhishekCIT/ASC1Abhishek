EPIC Number: 32
User Story Number: 3
User Story Title: As a compliance officer, I want audit logs for all scheduled report activities, so that I can ensure traceability and accountability for report generation and delivery.

User Story Description: Every action related to scheduling, editing, cancelling, and delivering reports must be logged with user, timestamp, action type, and outcome. This is required for compliance and troubleshooting.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. All scheduling, editing, and cancellation actions are logged with user and timestamp.
2. Delivery attempts (success/failure) are logged for each scheduled report.
3. Logs can be queried and exported by authorized users.

Validations:
1. No log entry should be missing required fields.
2. Only authorized users can access audit logs.
3. Log retention policy is enforced (e.g., 7 years).

Business Logic:
- Every relevant action triggers a log entry in the audit log database.
- Logs are immutable and tamper-evident.
- Access to logs is restricted and monitored.

Technical Context:
- Audit logs stored in a secure, append-only table in SQL Server or Azure Table Storage.
- Log access via admin interface with RBAC.
- Export functionality supports CSV/Excel format.

Non-Functional Requirements:
- Audit logs must be available for search within 1 minute of event.
- Logs must be protected against unauthorized modification.
- System must support at least 10 million log entries per year.

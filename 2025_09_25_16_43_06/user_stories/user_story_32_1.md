User Story Title: As a business user, I want to schedule automated reports, so that I receive relevant data insights at regular intervals without manual intervention.

User Story Description: This feature will allow business users to configure and schedule reports to be generated and delivered automatically based on a defined schedule (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly). The user can select the report type, frequency, recipients, and delivery method (email, download link, etc.).

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Users can select a report and set a schedule (frequency, start date, end date).
2. Users can specify recipients for the scheduled report.
3. The system generates and delivers the report automatically at the scheduled time.
4. Users receive notifications upon successful or failed report delivery.
5. Users can view, edit, or cancel scheduled reports.

Validations:
1. Scheduling frequency must be one of the allowed options (daily, weekly, monthly).
2. Recipient email addresses must be valid.
3. Report generation should not occur outside the defined start/end dates.

Business Logic: 
- When a user schedules a report, the system stores the configuration in the scheduling database.
- A scheduler service checks for due reports and triggers report generation.
- Upon completion, the report is delivered via the selected method and notifications are sent.

Technical Context:
- Technology stack: .NET Core backend, Angular frontend, SQL Server for scheduling data.
- Scheduler implemented as a background service or Azure Function.
- Email delivery via SMTP or SendGrid API.
- Reports generated in PDF/Excel format.
- Secure access via OAuth2 authentication.

Non-Functional Requirements:
- Reports must be generated and delivered within 5 minutes of the scheduled time.
- System must support at least 1000 concurrent scheduled reports.
- All data transmissions must be encrypted (TLS 1.2+).
- Monitoring and alerting for failed report deliveries.

EPIC Number: 3
User Story Number: 2
User Story Title: As an airline administrator, I want to manage flight schedules and seat inventory, so that I can keep the booking system up to date and maximize seat utilization.

User Story Description: This user story covers the ability for airline administrators to add, update, or remove flight schedules, and manage the number of available seats for each flight. The system should allow real-time updates and reflect changes immediately to end users.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Administrators can log in securely to the admin portal.
2. Administrators can add new flights with all relevant details (flight number, route, timings, aircraft type, seat capacity).
3. Administrators can update or cancel existing flights.
4. Changes in seat inventory are reflected in real-time to the booking system.

Validations:
1. Only authorized users can access the admin portal.
2. Flight details must be validated for completeness and correctness.
3. Updates to seat inventory must not result in overbooking.

Business Logic:
- Flight schedule management must synchronize with the booking engine to ensure no bookings are lost or overbooked.
- Seat inventory adjustments must be atomic and consistent across all systems.

Technical Context:
- Technology stack: React.js frontend for admin portal, Node.js backend, integration with airline core systems.
- Data formats: JSON for API communication.
- Security: Role-based access control, audit logs, HTTPS.

Non-Functional Requirements:
- Admin portal must be available 24/7 with 99.9% uptime.
- Changes should propagate to user-facing systems within 2 seconds.
- All admin actions must be logged for compliance and auditing.
- System must support concurrent updates by multiple administrators.

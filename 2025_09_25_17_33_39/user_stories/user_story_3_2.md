EPIC Number: 3
User Story Number: 2
User Story Title: As a traveler, I want to view and manage my air transport bookings, So that I can keep track of my travel plans and make changes if needed.

User Story Description: This feature will allow users to view their upcoming and past flight bookings, check details, and make modifications such as changing dates or passenger information. Users should also be able to cancel bookings if required.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Users can view a list of all their bookings.
2. Users can see detailed information for each booking.
3. Users can modify or cancel bookings within allowed timeframes.

Validations:
1. Validate user authentication before displaying bookings.
2. Validate modification requests against airline policies.
3. Validate cancellation requests and refund eligibility.

Business Logic: The system should fetch booking data from its database and synchronize with airline systems for updates. Modification and cancellation requests should be validated against airline rules. Pseudocode:
IF user_authenticated THEN
  FETCH bookings FROM database
  DISPLAY bookings
  IF user_requests_modification OR cancellation THEN
    VALIDATE request WITH airline_policy
    UPDATE booking status
END IF

Technical Context: Technology stack: .NET Core backend, React frontend, RESTful API integration, secure HTTPS communication, JWT for user authentication, JSON data format.

Non-Functional Requirements: Response time <2s for viewing bookings, 99.9% uptime, secure access to booking data, audit trail for all changes, scalable to support high user volume.

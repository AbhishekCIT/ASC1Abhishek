User Story Title: As a traveler, I want to book air transport tickets online, So that I can conveniently plan my journey.

User Story Description: This feature will allow users to search for available flights, compare options, and book tickets through the application. The system should support multiple airlines and provide real-time availability and pricing.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Users can search for flights by date, destination, and number of passengers.
2. Users can view available flights and select preferred options.
3. Users can complete the booking and receive confirmation.

Validations:
1. Validate that all required fields are filled before searching.
2. Validate payment information before processing booking.
3. Validate that the selected flight has available seats.

IF search_criteria_valid THEN
  FETCH flights FROM airline_APIs
  DISPLAY flights
  IF user_selects_flight THEN
    VALIDATE seat_availability
    PROCESS payment
    CONFIRM booking
END IF

Technical Context: Technology stack: .NET Core backend, React frontend, RESTful API integration with airline systems, data in JSON format, secure HTTPS communication, OAuth2 for authentication.

Non-Functional Requirements: Response time <2s for search, 99.9% uptime, PCI DSS compliant payment processing, scalable to handle peak loads, audit logging for all transactions.

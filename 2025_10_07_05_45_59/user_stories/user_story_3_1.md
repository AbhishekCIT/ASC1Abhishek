User Story Number: 1
User Story Title: As a user, I want to perform basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide), So that I can calculate simple mathematical results quickly.

User Story Description: This user story covers the implementation of basic arithmetic functionality in the calculator application. The calculator should allow users to input two numbers and select an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) to compute the result.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. The calculator must allow input of two numbers.
2. The calculator must provide buttons or options for add, subtract, multiply, and divide.
3. The result must be displayed clearly after the operation is performed.
4. Division by zero must be handled gracefully with an error message.

Validations:
1. Only valid numeric inputs are accepted.
2. Division by zero is not allowed and triggers an error message.
3. The result is recalculated and updated each time an operation is performed.

Business Logic: 
- Accept two numeric inputs from the user.
- Based on the selected operation, perform the corresponding arithmetic calculation.
- If division is selected and the second number is zero, display an error message and do not perform the calculation.
- Display the result in a designated area.

Technical Context: 
- Technology stack: Web application using React (frontend), Node.js (backend, if needed)
- No external API required for basic operations.
- Data formats: JSON for any internal communication.
- Security: Input sanitization to prevent injection attacks.

Non-Functional Requirements:
- Performance: Each calculation should complete in less than 100ms.
- Availability: 99.9% uptime for the calculator service.
- Security: Input validation and sanitization.
- Scalability: Should support at least 100 concurrent users.
- Analytics: Log each operation for usage analytics.
- Monitoring: Application health monitored via logging and alerts.

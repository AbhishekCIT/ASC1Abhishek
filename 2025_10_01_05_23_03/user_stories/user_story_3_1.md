User Story Title: As a passenger, I want to book air transport tickets online, So that I can conveniently plan my travel.

User Story Description: This user story covers the ability for passengers to search for available flights, select preferred options, and book tickets through an online platform. The feature should include options for one-way, round-trip, and multi-city bookings, as well as the ability to view flight details, prices, and seat availability.

User Story Title: As a passenger, I want to access customer support easily, So that I can resolve any issues or questions related to my air transport booking.

User Story Description: This user story covers the ability for passengers to contact customer support through multiple channels (chat, email, phone) for help with booking, baggage, check-in, or other travel-related issues. The system should provide quick access to FAQs and live support agents.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Passengers can initiate support requests via chat, email, or phone.
2. The system provides automated responses for common queries (FAQs).
3. Passengers can escalate issues to a live agent if needed.

Validations:
1. Support requests are logged and tracked until resolution.
2. Automated responses are accurate and up-to-date.
3. Live agent handoff occurs within a specified response time.

Business Logic: The system routes support requests to the appropriate channel, uses AI/ML for automated FAQ responses, and escalates complex issues to human agents. All interactions are logged for quality and compliance.

Technical Context: The feature will use a customer support platform (e.g., Zendesk, Freshdesk), integrate with chatbots for automation, and provide APIs for ticket tracking. Data privacy and secure communication are enforced.

Non-Functional Requirements: The system must provide 24/7 support availability, ensure response times under 2 minutes for chat, and maintain 99.9% uptime for support channels.

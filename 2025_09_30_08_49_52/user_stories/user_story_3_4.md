User Story Title: As a passenger, I want to receive real-time notifications about my flight status, So that I can stay informed about delays, gate changes, or cancellations.

User Story Description: This user story covers the ability for passengers to receive timely notifications about their flight status, including delays, gate changes, cancellations, and boarding announcements. Notifications should be sent via email, SMS, and in-app alerts.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Passengers receive notifications for any changes to their flight status.
2. Notifications are sent via the passenger’s preferred channels (email, SMS, app).
3. All notifications contain clear and actionable information.

Validations:
1. Notification preferences are configurable by the passenger.
2. Only relevant notifications are sent based on the passenger’s booking.
3. Notification delivery is logged for auditing.

Business Logic: The system monitors flight status updates from airline systems in real-time, matches updates to passenger bookings, and triggers notifications according to user preferences.

Technical Context: The feature will use a messaging service (e.g., Twilio for SMS, SendGrid for email, push notifications for app), integrate with airline APIs for real-time status, and store notification logs in a secure database.

Non-Functional Requirements: The system must deliver notifications within 1 minute of status changes, support high message throughput, ensure data privacy, and provide 99.9% notification delivery reliability.

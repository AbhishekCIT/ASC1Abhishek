User Story Title: As a passenger, I want to book air transport tickets online, So that I can conveniently plan my travel.

User Story Description: This user story covers the ability for passengers to search for flights, select preferred options, and book tickets through an online platform. The feature should support searching by destination, dates, and class, and provide a seamless booking experience.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Passengers can search for available flights by entering origin, destination, and dates.
2. Passengers can view flight options with prices and timings.
3. Passengers can select a flight and complete the booking by providing personal and payment details.
4. Confirmation is sent to the passenger after successful booking.

Validations:
1. Origin and destination cannot be the same.
2. Dates must be in the future.
3. Payment details must be valid and authorized.

Business Logic: The system should query available flights based on user input, calculate prices including taxes and fees, and process payment securely. Upon successful payment, a booking record is created and confirmation is sent via email/SMS.

Technical Context: The application will use a web frontend (React), backend APIs (Node.js/Express), and integrate with airline reservation systems via REST APIs. Data will be stored in a relational database (PostgreSQL). Payment processing will use a secure third-party gateway (e.g., Stripe). All data transfers must be encrypted (HTTPS).

Non-Functional Requirements: The system must handle at least 1000 concurrent users, provide 99.9% uptime, ensure PCI DSS compliance for payments, and log all transactions for monitoring and analytics.

User Story Title: As a passenger, I want to book a flight ticket online, So that I can travel to my destination conveniently.

User Story Description: This feature allows passengers to search for available flights, select preferred dates and times, and book tickets through an online portal. The system should provide real-time availability, pricing, and confirmation of bookings.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Users can search for flights by origin, destination, and date.
2. Users can view available flights with pricing and timings.
3. Users can complete the booking and receive a confirmation.

Validations:
1. Ensure the entered travel dates are valid and not in the past.
2. Validate passenger details (name, contact, ID) during booking.
3. Ensure payment is processed securely and booking is confirmed only after payment.

Business Logic: The system checks flight availability, calculates pricing based on class and demand, reserves seats, and processes payment. If payment fails, the booking is not confirmed and seats are released.

Technical Context: Web application using React frontend, Node.js backend, RESTful APIs to airline reservation systems, secure payment gateway integration (PCI DSS compliant), data in JSON format, HTTPS enforced.

Non-Functional Requirements: System must handle 1000 concurrent users, 99.9% uptime, response time <2 seconds for search, data encrypted in transit and at rest, audit logs for all transactions.

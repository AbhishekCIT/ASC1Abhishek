EPIC Number: 3
User Story Number: 1
User Story Title: As a user, I want to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), so that I can quickly calculate results for simple math problems.

User Story Description: The calculator should allow users to input two numbers and select an arithmetic operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide). The result should be displayed instantly after the operation is selected. The interface should be intuitive and responsive.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. The calculator allows input of two numbers.
2. The user can select one of the four operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
3. The result is displayed immediately after the operation is performed.
4. Division by zero is handled gracefully with an appropriate error message.

Validations:
1. Only numeric input is accepted for both numbers.
2. Division by zero is not allowed and triggers an error message.
3. The result is recalculated if either input value or operation changes.

Business Logic: 
- Addition: result = number1 + number2
- Subtraction: result = number1 - number2
- Multiplication: result = number1 * number2
- Division: if number2 != 0 then result = number1 / number2 else show error

Technical Context: 
- Technology stack: ReactJS for frontend, Node.js for backend (if needed), HTML/CSS for UI
- No external APIs required
- Data format: JSON for any internal communication
- Security: No sensitive data, but input validation to prevent script injection

Non-Functional Requirements:
- Performance: Calculation and display of result must be instantaneous (<100ms)
- Availability: 99.9% uptime
- Security: Input validation, no code injection
- Scalability: Should support at least 100 concurrent users
- Analytics: Log usage statistics (number of calculations performed)
- Monitoring: Basic health checks for frontend/backend

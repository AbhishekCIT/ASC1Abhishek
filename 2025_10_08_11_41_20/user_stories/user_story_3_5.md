EPIC Number: 3
User Story Number: 5
User Story Title: As a user, I want to use my keyboard to enter numbers and select operations, so that I can perform calculations more efficiently.

User Story Description: The calculator should support keyboard input for numbers, decimal points, and arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /). The Enter key should trigger the calculation, and the Escape key should clear the input. This improves accessibility and speed for power users.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Number keys (0-9) and decimal point can be used to enter values.
2. Operator keys (+, -, *, /) select the corresponding operation.
3. Enter key triggers calculation and displays result.
4. Escape key clears input and result.

Validations:
1. Only valid keys are accepted; invalid keys are ignored.
2. Keyboard shortcuts do not interfere with other browser shortcuts.
3. Input fields update correctly with keyboard input.

Business Logic:
- Listen for keydown events on the calculator component.
- Map key codes to calculator actions (input, operation, calculate, clear).
- Prevent default browser actions for handled keys if necessary.

Technical Context:
- Technology stack: ReactJS for frontend
- Use JavaScript event listeners for keyboard support
- No backend/API required
- Security: Prevent script injection via keyboard input

Non-Functional Requirements:
- Performance: Keyboard input must be responsive (<50ms delay)
- Availability: 99.9% uptime
- Security: Input validation for all keyboard events
- Scalability: Should support at least 100 concurrent users
- Analytics: Track usage of keyboard shortcuts
- Monitoring: Log errors related to keyboard input

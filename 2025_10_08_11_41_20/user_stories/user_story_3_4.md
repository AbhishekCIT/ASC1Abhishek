EPIC Number: 3
User Story Number: 4
User Story Title: As a user, I want to view a history of my recent calculations, so that I can refer back to previous results without re-entering data.

User Story Description: The calculator should maintain a history of the last 10 calculations performed in the current session. Each history entry should include the operands, operation, and result. Users should be able to clear the history if desired.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. The last 10 calculations are displayed in a history panel.
2. Each entry shows both operands, the operation, and the result.
3. A 'Clear History' button removes all history entries.

Validations:
1. Only calculations from the current session are shown.
2. No more than 10 entries are displayed; oldest entries are removed as new ones are added.
3. Clearing history removes all entries and resets the panel.

Business Logic:
- Store each calculation as an object in an array (max length 10).
- On new calculation, append to array; if array exceeds 10, remove the oldest.
- On 'Clear History', empty the array.

Technical Context:
- Technology stack: ReactJS for frontend
- Use local state or browser localStorage/sessionStorage for history
- No backend/API required
- Security: History is session-based and not persisted beyond browser session

Non-Functional Requirements:
- Performance: History updates must be instantaneous
- Availability: 99.9% uptime
- Security: No sensitive data stored
- Scalability: Should support at least 100 concurrent users
- Analytics: Track usage of history feature
- Monitoring: Log errors related to history display

User Story Number: 3
User Story Title: As a user, I want to enter and calculate with decimal numbers, so that I can perform more precise calculations.

User Story Description: The calculator should accept decimal numbers as input for both operands. All arithmetic operations should support decimal values, and results should be displayed with appropriate precision.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Input fields accept decimal numbers.
2. All four operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) work with decimal numbers.
3. Results are displayed with up to 4 decimal places.

Validations:
1. Only valid decimal numbers are accepted (e.g., 12.34, -0.56).
2. Input of multiple decimal points in a single number is not allowed.
3. Results are rounded to 4 decimal places if necessary.

Business Logic:
- Parse input as floating-point numbers.
- Perform arithmetic using floating-point operations.
- Round result to 4 decimal places for display.

Technical Context:
- Technology stack: ReactJS for frontend
- Input validation using JavaScript regex or HTML5 input types
- No backend/API required for this feature
- Security: Prevent invalid input and script injection

Non-Functional Requirements:
- Performance: Calculation and display of result must be instantaneous (<100ms)
- Availability: 99.9% uptime
- Security: Input validation for decimals
- Scalability: Should support at least 100 concurrent users
- Analytics: Track number of decimal calculations
- Monitoring: Log errors related to decimal input

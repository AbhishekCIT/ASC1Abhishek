User Story Title: As a user, I want to clear the calculator input and result, so that I can quickly start a new calculation without refreshing the page.

User Story Description: The calculator should provide a 'Clear' button that resets both the input fields and the result display. This allows users to efficiently perform multiple calculations in sequence.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. A 'Clear' button is visible and accessible.
2. Clicking 'Clear' resets both input fields and the result display.
3. No residual data remains after clearing.

Validations:
1. All input fields are empty after clearing.
2. The result display is blank or reset to default state.
3. No calculation is performed after clearing until new input is provided.

Business Logic:
- On 'Clear' button click, set input fields and result display to empty or default values.

Technical Context:
- Technology stack: ReactJS for frontend
- No backend/API required for this feature
- Security: Prevent accidental double-submission or race conditions

Non-Functional Requirements:
- Performance: Clearing should be instantaneous
- Availability: 99.9% uptime
- Security: No sensitive data, but ensure no input persists after clearing
- Scalability: Should support at least 100 concurrent users
- Analytics: Track usage of 'Clear' button
- Monitoring: Log errors if clearing fails

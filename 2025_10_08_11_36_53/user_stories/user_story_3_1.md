EPIC Number: 3
User Story Number: 1
User Story Title: As a user, I want to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), so that I can quickly calculate results for simple math problems.

User Story Description: The calculator should allow users to input two numbers and select an arithmetic operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide). Upon pressing 'calculate', the result should be displayed instantly. The interface should be intuitive and responsive, suitable for both desktop and mobile users.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. User can input two numbers.
2. User can select one of the four basic arithmetic operations.
3. Result is displayed immediately after calculation.
4. Handles division by zero gracefully with an error message.
5. Supports both integer and decimal numbers.

Validations:
1. Inputs must be valid numbers (integer or decimal).
2. Division by zero should not be allowed; display a clear error message.
3. Only one operation can be performed at a time.

Business Logic: 
- On 'calculate', perform the selected operation on the two inputs.
- If division is selected and the second input is zero, display 'Cannot divide by zero'.
- Accept both integer and decimal inputs.
- Pseudocode:
  if operation == 'add': result = num1 + num2
  elif operation == 'subtract': result = num1 - num2
  elif operation == 'multiply': result = num1 * num2
  elif operation == 'divide':
      if num2 == 0: show error
      else: result = num1 / num2

Technical Context:
- Technology Stack: React (frontend), Node.js (backend, if needed)
- Frameworks: Material UI for UI components
- API: None required for basic operations
- Data Format: JSON for any internal data exchange
- Security: Input validation to prevent code injection

Non-Functional Requirements:
- Performance: Calculation should be instant (<100ms)
- Availability: 99.9% uptime
- Security: Validate all user inputs
- Scalability: Should support up to 1000 concurrent users
- Analytics: Track usage frequency of each operation
- Monitoring: Log errors and failed calculations

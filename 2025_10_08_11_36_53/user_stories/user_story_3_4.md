EPIC Number: 3
User Story Number: 4
User Story Title: As a user, I want to use keyboard shortcuts to enter numbers and select operations, so that I can operate the calculator efficiently without using a mouse.

User Story Description: The calculator should support keyboard input for entering numbers, selecting operations (+, -, *, /), and triggering calculation or clearing/resetting. This improves accessibility and speed for users who prefer keyboard navigation or have limited mouse access.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Users can enter numbers using the keyboard.
2. Users can select operations using keyboard shortcuts.
3. Users can press 'Enter' to calculate and 'Esc' or 'C' to clear/reset.
4. All calculator functions are accessible via keyboard.

Validations:
1. Only valid keyboard inputs are accepted.
2. Invalid key presses do not trigger any action.
3. Keyboard shortcuts are documented and visible to users.

Business Logic:
- Map number keys to input fields.
- Map '+', '-', '*', '/' keys to operation selection.
- Map 'Enter' to calculation, 'Esc' or 'C' to clear/reset.
- Pseudocode:
  onKeyPress(event):
    if event.key in [0-9]: update input
    if event.key in ['+', '-', '*', '/']: select operation
    if event.key == 'Enter': calculate
    if event.key in ['Esc', 'C']: clear

Technical Context:
- Technology Stack: React
- Event Handling: JavaScript event listeners
- UI Framework: Material UI
- Security: Prevent unwanted key events

Non-Functional Requirements:
- Performance: Instant response to key presses
- Availability: Feature always accessible
- Security: Sanitize all keyboard input
- Scalability: Works for all users
- Monitoring: Log usage of keyboard shortcuts

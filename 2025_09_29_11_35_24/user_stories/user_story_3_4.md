EPIC Number: 3
User Story Number: 4
User Story Title: As a traveler, I want to receive notifications about my flight status and booking updates, so that I stay informed about any changes or important information.

User Story Description: This feature ensures users receive timely notifications (via email, SMS, or app push) about booking confirmations, flight status changes (delays, cancellations), gate changes, and reminders for check-in.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. User receives notification for booking confirmation.
2. User receives real-time updates for flight status changes.
3. User receives reminders for check-in and boarding.
4. User can configure notification preferences (email, SMS, push).

Validations:
1. Notification delivery is logged and can be audited.
2. User preferences are respected for notification channels.
3. Only relevant notifications are sent to each user.

Business Logic: The system subscribes users to relevant events based on their bookings. It triggers notifications when events occur, using user preferences to determine the channel.

Technical Context: Integration with notification services (SendGrid for email, Twilio for SMS, Firebase for push). Backend in Node.js, event-driven architecture (e.g., RabbitMQ or AWS SNS). Data in PostgreSQL.

Non-Functional Requirements: Notifications must be delivered within 1 minute of event occurrence. System must support high throughput (10,000 notifications/minute). All notification data must be encrypted in transit and at rest.

User Story Title: As a traveler, I want to search for available flights, so that I can find suitable air transport options for my journey.

User Story Description: This feature allows users to search for available flights by entering their source, destination, travel dates, and number of passengers. The system should display a list of matching flights with details such as airline, timings, duration, and price.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. User can enter source, destination, travel dates, and passenger count.
2. System displays a list of available flights matching the criteria.
3. Each flight result includes airline name, flight number, timings, duration, and price.
4. User can filter results by airline, price, or duration.

Validations:
1. Source and destination cannot be the same.
2. Travel date cannot be in the past.
3. Passenger count must be at least 1 and not exceed the maximum allowed per booking.

Business Logic: The system queries the flight database or external APIs based on user input. It applies filters and sorts results as per user preferences. If no flights are found, display a suitable message.

Technical Context: Frontend built with React, backend with Node.js/Express, flight data sourced from third-party APIs (e.g., Amadeus, Sabre). RESTful API integration, JSON data format, secure API keys, and HTTPS for data transmission.

Non-Functional Requirements: Search results should be displayed within 3 seconds. System must support at least 10,000 concurrent searches. Data must be encrypted in transit. System should log search queries for analytics and monitoring.

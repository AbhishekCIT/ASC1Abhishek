User Story Title: As a traveler, I want to book air transport tickets online, So that I can conveniently plan my journeys.

User Story Description: This user story covers the functionality for travelers to search for, select, and book air transport tickets through the application. The system should allow users to view available flights, compare prices, select preferred options, and complete the booking process with secure payment.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Users can search for flights by date, destination, and class.
2. Users can view flight details and prices.
3. Users can select flights and proceed to booking.
4. Users can make secure payments and receive booking confirmation.

Validations:
1. Search inputs must be valid (e.g., valid dates, locations).
2. Payment information must be validated for correctness and security.
3. Booking confirmation is only sent after successful payment.

Business Logic: The system must query available flights from partner airlines, calculate prices including taxes and fees, and process bookings in real-time. If a seat is no longer available during booking, the user must be notified and prompted to select another option.

Technical Context: The application will use a modern web framework (e.g., React for frontend, Node.js/Java for backend), integrate with airline APIs for flight data, and use secure payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal). Data will be exchanged in JSON format over HTTPS. User authentication and data security are mandatory.

Non-Functional Requirements: The booking process must complete within 5 seconds under normal load. The system should be available 99.9% of the time, ensure PCI DSS compliance for payments, and support scaling to handle peak demand. All booking actions should be logged for analytics and monitoring.

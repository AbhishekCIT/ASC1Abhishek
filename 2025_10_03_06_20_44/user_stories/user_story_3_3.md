User Story Title: As a traveler, I want to cancel my air ticket and request a refund, So that I can manage unexpected changes in my travel plans.

User Story Description: This user story covers the process for users to cancel their booked tickets and request refunds according to airline policies. The system should display refund eligibility, applicable fees, and process the refund securely.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Users can view cancellation and refund policies before confirming cancellation.

Validations:
1. Cancellation requests are only allowed for eligible bookings.

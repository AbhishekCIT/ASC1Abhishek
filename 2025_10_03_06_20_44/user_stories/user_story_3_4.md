User Story Title: As a frequent flyer, I want to earn and redeem loyalty points, So that I can benefit from my repeat bookings.

User Story Description: This user story covers the functionality for users to earn loyalty points on each booking, view their points balance, and redeem points for discounts or free flights. The system should track points accurately and provide clear redemption options.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Users earn points automatically with each eligible booking.
2. Users can view their loyalty points balance and transaction history.
3. Users can redeem points for discounts or rewards during booking.

Validations:
1. Points are awarded only for completed and eligible bookings.
2. Redemption is allowed only if the user has sufficient points.
3. All loyalty transactions are logged and auditable.

Business Logic: The system must calculate points based on booking value and airline rules, update balances in real time, and deduct points upon redemption. Expiry rules for points must be enforced.

Technical Context: Integrate with a loyalty program engine or develop in-house logic. Use secure APIs for point transactions. Data must be encrypted and user authentication enforced.

Non-Functional Requirements: Points balance updates must be reflected within 1 minute of booking. The system must handle high volumes of loyalty transactions and provide 99.9% uptime. Analytics on loyalty usage must be available to business stakeholders.

User Story Title: As a passenger, I want to book a selected flight, so that I can reserve my seat and complete the purchase process.

User Story Description: This feature allows users to select a flight from the search results, enter passenger details, choose seats, and make a payment to complete the booking. The system should confirm the booking and provide a booking reference and e-ticket.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Users can select a flight and proceed to booking.
2. Users can enter passenger details and select seats.
3. Users can make payment using multiple payment options.
4. The system confirms the booking and sends a confirmation email with e-ticket.

Validations:
1. All passenger details must be provided and validated (name, passport, etc.).
2. Payment must be authorized and processed securely.
3. Selected seats must be available at the time of booking.

Business Logic: The system reserves the selected seats, processes the payment, and generates a unique booking reference. If payment fails, the booking is not confirmed and seats are released.

Technical Context: Frontend in React, backend in Node.js/Express. Payment gateway integration (e.g., Stripe, PayPal). Data in JSON format. All sensitive data encrypted in transit and at rest. PCI DSS compliance for payment processing.

Non-Functional Requirements: Booking process must complete within 5 seconds. System must be available 24/7. Data privacy and security as per GDPR and PCI DSS. Scalability to handle peak booking loads. Analytics on booking conversion rates. Monitoring with Azure Monitor.

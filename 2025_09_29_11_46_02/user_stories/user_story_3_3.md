User Story Title: As a passenger, I want to cancel my booked flight and request a refund, so that I can manage changes to my travel plans.

User Story Description: This feature enables users to cancel their booked flights and request refunds according to the airline's refund policy. The system should process the cancellation, update seat availability, and initiate the refund process if eligible.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Users can view and select bookings to cancel.
2. The system displays refund eligibility and amount based on fare rules.
3. Upon confirmation, the booking is cancelled and refund is initiated if applicable.
4. Users receive a cancellation confirmation and refund status notification.

Validations:
1. Only bookings eligible for cancellation can be cancelled.
2. Refund amount is calculated as per fare rules and displayed before confirmation.
3. Refunds are processed to the original payment method.

Business Logic: The system checks the fare rules for eligibility and calculates the refund. Upon cancellation, seats are released and the refund process is initiated. If non-refundable, the user is notified accordingly.

Technical Context: Frontend in React, backend in Node.js/Express. Integration with airline APIs for fare rules and booking management. Payment gateway integration for refunds. Data in JSON format. Secure handling of user and payment data.

Non-Functional Requirements: Cancellations processed within 2 minutes. Refunds initiated within 24 hours. System availability 99.9%. Compliance with GDPR and PCI DSS. Scalability for high cancellation volumes. Monitoring and alerts for failed refund transactions.

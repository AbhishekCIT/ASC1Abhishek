User Story Number: 1
User Story Title: As a traveler, I want to search for available air transport options, so that I can plan my journey efficiently.

User Story Description: This feature allows users to search for flights and air transport options based on their preferred dates, destinations, and other criteria. The system should provide a comprehensive list of available flights, including details such as departure and arrival times, airlines, and pricing. The purpose is to enable travelers to make informed decisions when planning their air travel.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Users can input origin, destination, and travel dates.
2. The system displays a list of available flights matching the criteria.
3. Each flight listing includes airline, departure/arrival times, price, and duration.
4. Users can filter results by airline, price range, and number of stops.
5. The search results are updated in real-time based on user input.

Validations:
1. Origin and destination fields must not be empty.
2. Travel dates must be valid and not in the past.
3. Search results must match the input criteria.

Business Logic: The system queries flight databases and APIs to retrieve available flights. It applies user filters and sorts results based on relevance. Pseudocode:
- If origin, destination, and dates are valid:
  - Query flight API with parameters
  - Filter results as per user selections
  - Display sorted list to user

Technical Context: Technology stack includes React (frontend), Node.js (backend), and integration with flight data APIs (e.g., Amadeus, Sabre). Data formats: JSON for API responses. Security considerations: HTTPS for all API calls, input validation, and protection against injection attacks.

Non-Functional Requirements:
- Performance: Search results should be displayed within 2 seconds.
- Availability: System should be available 99.9% of the time.
- Security: User data and search queries must be encrypted.
- Scalability: System should support high concurrent searches.
- Analytics: Track popular routes and search patterns.
- Monitoring: Implement real-time monitoring for API failures and latency.

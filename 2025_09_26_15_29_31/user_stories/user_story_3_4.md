User Story Title: As a traveler, I want to receive notifications and updates about my air transport bookings, so that I stay informed about schedule changes and important information.

User Story Description: This feature provides travelers with timely notifications regarding their bookings, such as flight delays, cancellations, gate changes, and reminders for check-in. Notifications are sent via email, SMS, or in-app alerts. The purpose is to keep travelers informed and reduce travel disruptions.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Users receive notifications for booking confirmations, changes, and cancellations.
2. Users are alerted about flight delays, gate changes, and check-in reminders.

5. Users can manage notification preferences in their profile.

Validations:

User Story Title: As a traveler, I want to view and manage my air transport bookings, so that I can make changes or cancellations if needed.

User Story Description: This feature allows users to view their current and past bookings, make changes such as rescheduling or canceling flights, and access their travel documents. The purpose is to provide flexibility and control over travel plans.

Acceptance Criteria:

2. Users can select a booking to view details and itinerary.
3. Users can request changes (reschedule, cancel) as per airline policies.
4. Users receive confirmation for any changes made.
5. System handles errors and displays relevant messages.

Validations:

    - Validate against airline rules
    - Update booking
    - Send confirmation

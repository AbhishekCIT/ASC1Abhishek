EPIC Number: 3
User Story Number: 1
User Story Title: As a user, I want to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), So that I can quickly calculate results for simple math problems.

User Story Description: The calculator should allow users to input two numbers and select an arithmetic operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide). The result should be displayed clearly after the operation is performed. The interface should be intuitive and responsive, supporting both mouse and keyboard input.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. User can input two numbers.
2. User can select one of four operations: add, subtract, multiply, divide.
3. Result is displayed immediately after operation is performed.
4. Handles division by zero gracefully with an error message.
5. Supports both integer and decimal numbers.

Validations:
1. Inputs must be valid numbers (integer or decimal).
2. Division by zero triggers an error message and does not crash the app.
3. All operations return correct results.

Business Logic: 
- Addition: result = num1 + num2
- Subtraction: result = num1 - num2
- Multiplication: result = num1 * num2
- Division: if num2 != 0 then result = num1 / num2 else show error
- Input validation: check if both inputs are numbers before performing operation

Technical Context:
- Technology stack: ReactJS (frontend), Node.js (backend, if needed)
- Frameworks: Material UI for UI components
- No external API required; all calculations are local
- Data format: JSON for any internal state
- Security: Input sanitization to prevent injection attacks

Non-Functional Requirements:
- Performance: Results should be calculated and displayed within 100ms
- Availability: 99.9% uptime for web app
- Security: Validate all user inputs
- Scalability: Should support up to 1000 concurrent users
- Analytics: Track usage of each operation for future improvements
- Monitoring: Log errors and user actions for troubleshooting

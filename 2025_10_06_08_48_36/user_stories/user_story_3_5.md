EPIC Number: 3
User Story Number: 5
User Story Title: As a user, I want clear error messages when something goes wrong, So that I understand the issue and can correct my input or actions.

User Story Description: The calculator should provide clear, actionable error messages for invalid inputs, calculation errors (such as division by zero), and system issues. Error messages should be displayed prominently and guide the user to resolve the problem.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Error messages are displayed in a dedicated area when an error occurs.
2. Error messages are specific and actionable (e.g., "Cannot divide by zero").
3. User can dismiss error messages easily.
4. No calculation is performed when there is an error.

Validations:
1. All possible error scenarios are covered with appropriate messages.
2. Error messages disappear when the issue is resolved.
3. No calculation result is shown if an error is present.

Business Logic:
- On error, set error state and display message
- Prevent calculation if error state is active
- Clear error state when user corrects input

Technical Context:
- Technology stack: ReactJS
- Error handling via component state
- UI: Error message area styled for visibility
- Security: Prevent exposure of internal system errors

Non-Functional Requirements:
- Performance: Error messages display within 50ms of error detection
- Accessibility: Error messages are screen-reader friendly
- Monitoring: Log error occurrences for troubleshooting

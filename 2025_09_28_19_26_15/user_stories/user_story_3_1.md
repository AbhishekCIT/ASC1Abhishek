EPIC Number: 3
User Story Number: 1
User Story Title: As a user, I want to perform basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide), so that I can calculate simple mathematical expressions.

User Story Description: The calculator should allow users to input two numbers and select an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). The result should be displayed clearly after the operation is performed. The interface should be intuitive and responsive.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. The calculator accepts two numeric inputs.
2. The user can select one of the four operations: add, subtract, multiply, divide.
3. The correct result is displayed after the operation.
4. Division by zero is handled gracefully with an error message.
5. The UI is responsive and accessible.

Validations:
1. Only numeric input is accepted.
2. Division by zero triggers an appropriate error message.
3. Input fields cannot be empty before calculation.

Business Logic: 
- Addition: result = num1 + num2
- Subtraction: result = num1 - num2
- Multiplication: result = num1 * num2
- Division: if num2 != 0 then result = num1 / num2 else error

Technical Context: 
- Technology stack: React (frontend), Node.js (backend, if needed)
- No external API required; all calculations are client-side.
- Data format: JSON for any internal data passing.
- Security: Input sanitization to prevent code injection.

Non-Functional Requirements:
- Response time for calculation < 1 second.
- Application available 99.9% of the time.
- Secure handling of user input.
- Scalable to support multiple concurrent users.
- Basic analytics for operation usage.
- Monitoring for error rates and downtime.

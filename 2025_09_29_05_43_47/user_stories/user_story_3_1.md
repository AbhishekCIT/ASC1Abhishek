EPIC Number: 3
User Story Number: 1
User Story Title: As a user, I want to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), So that I can quickly calculate results for simple math problems

User Story Description: This feature allows users to input two numbers and select an arithmetic operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide) to get the result. The calculator should support both integer and decimal values, and provide immediate feedback for invalid operations (e.g., division by zero).

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Users can input two numbers for calculation
2. Users can select one of the four basic operations
3. The result is displayed immediately after the operation is selected
4. Division by zero is handled gracefully with an error message
5. Supports both integer and decimal inputs

Validations:
1. Only numeric input is accepted in the input fields
2. Division by zero triggers a clear error message and does not crash the app
3. Results are rounded to two decimal places for decimal operations

Business Logic: 
- Addition: result = num1 + num2
- Subtraction: result = num1 - num2
- Multiplication: result = num1 * num2
- Division: if num2 != 0, result = num1 / num2; else show error
- Input validation: Ensure both inputs are valid numbers before performing any operation

Technical Context: 
- Technology stack: ReactJS (frontend), Node.js (backend, if needed)
- No external API required; all calculations are performed client-side
- Data format: JSON for any internal data passing
- Security: Input sanitization to prevent code injection

Non-Functional Requirements:
- Performance: Calculation result should be displayed in less than 100ms
- Availability: 99.9% uptime
- Security: Input validation and sanitization
- Scalability: Should support up to 1000 concurrent users
- Analytics: Log usage statistics for operations performed
- Monitoring: Monitor error rates and response times

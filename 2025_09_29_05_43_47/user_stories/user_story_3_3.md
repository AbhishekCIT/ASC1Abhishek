EPIC Number: 3
User Story Number: 3
User Story Title: As a user, I want to use my keyboard to enter numbers and operations, So that I can perform calculations more efficiently

User Story Description: This feature allows users to use their keyboard to input numbers, select operations (using keys like +, -, *, /), and press Enter to get results, improving accessibility and speed for power users.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Users can use number keys to input values
2. Users can use +, -, *, / keys to select operations
3. Pressing Enter triggers the calculation
4. Pressing Escape clears the calculator

Validations:
1. Only valid keys are accepted for input and operations
2. Invalid key presses do not affect the calculator state
3. Keyboard shortcuts work consistently across browsers

Business Logic:
- Map keyboard events to corresponding calculator functions
- Prevent default browser behavior for mapped keys (where necessary)

Technical Context:
- Technology stack: ReactJS
- Use JavaScript event listeners for keyboard input
- Security: Prevent script injection via keyboard input

Non-Functional Requirements:
- Performance: Keyboard input should be processed in real time
- Accessibility: Feature should work with screen readers
- Analytics: Log usage of keyboard shortcuts
- Monitoring: Track errors related to keyboard input

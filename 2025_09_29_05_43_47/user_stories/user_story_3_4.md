EPIC Number: 3
User Story Number: 4
User Story Title: As a user, I want the calculator interface to be user-friendly and accessible, So that I can use it easily on any device and by users with disabilities

User Story Description: This feature ensures that the calculator UI is intuitive, visually appealing, responsive to different screen sizes, and accessible to users with disabilities (e.g., screen reader support, keyboard navigation, color contrast compliance).

Acceptance Criteria:
1. The calculator UI is responsive and adapts to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile)
2. All interactive elements are accessible via keyboard navigation
3. The UI meets WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards (color contrast, ARIA labels, etc.)
4. The layout is intuitive and visually clear

Validations:
1. UI passes accessibility testing tools (e.g., axe, Lighthouse)
2. All buttons and inputs are reachable and usable via keyboard
3. Color contrast meets accessibility guidelines

Business Logic:
- Use semantic HTML elements and ARIA attributes for accessibility
- Implement responsive CSS for layout adaptation
- Ensure all actions are available via keyboard shortcuts

Technical Context:
- Technology stack: ReactJS, CSS3 (Flexbox/Grid), ARIA attributes
- No backend required
- Security: Prevent focus hijacking and ensure safe navigation

Non-Functional Requirements:
- Performance: UI should load and render in less than 1 second
- Accessibility: Must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- Scalability: UI should remain usable with increased number of users
- Analytics: Track device/browser usage and accessibility errors
- Monitoring: Monitor UI load times and accessibility compliance

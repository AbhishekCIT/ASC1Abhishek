EPIC Number: 32
User Story Number: 4
User Story Title: As an administrator, I want to audit all scheduling, editing, and delivery actions for reports, so that I can ensure compliance and traceability.

User Story Description: This feature will log all actions related to report scheduling, editing, deletion, and delivery, including user identity, timestamps, and action details. Administrators will have access to an audit log interface for monitoring and compliance purposes.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. All scheduling, editing, and deletion actions are logged with user, timestamp, and action details.
2. All report deliveries (success/failure) are logged.
3. Administrators can view and filter audit logs by user, action, or date range.

Validations:
1. Audit logs must be immutable and tamper-proof.
2. Only authorized administrators can access audit logs.
3. Logs must be retained according to company policy (e.g., 1 year).

Business Logic:
- On any scheduling-related action, write a log entry with all relevant details.
- Provide an interface for administrators to query and filter logs.
- Ensure logs cannot be modified or deleted by users.

Technical Context:
- Technology stack: .NET Core backend, Angular frontend, Azure SQL Database or Azure Log Analytics for log storage.
- Security: Access control for audit log viewing, encryption at rest.

Non-Functional Requirements:
- Audit log interface must return results within 3 seconds for up to 10,000 records.
- Logs must be available for export in CSV format.
- System must support regulatory compliance (e.g., SOX, GDPR).

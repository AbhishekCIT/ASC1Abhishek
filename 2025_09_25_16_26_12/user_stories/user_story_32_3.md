EPIC Number: 32
User Story Number: 3
User Story Title: As a business user, I want to receive notifications about the status of my scheduled reports, so that I am aware of successful deliveries or any failures.

User Story Description: This feature will notify users via email or in-app notifications when a scheduled report is successfully delivered or if there is a failure (e.g., data source unavailable, delivery failed). Users should be able to configure their notification preferences for each schedule.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Users receive notifications upon successful report delivery.
2. Users receive failure notifications with error details and suggested actions.
3. Users can configure notification preferences (email, in-app, both).

Validations:
1. Notification preferences must be saved and respected for each schedule.
2. Failure notifications must include actionable information.
3. Notifications must not be sent to unauthorized recipients.

Business Logic:
- On report delivery or failure, trigger notification logic.
- Fetch user preferences and send notifications accordingly.
- Log all notifications sent for auditing.

Technical Context:
- Technology stack: .NET Core backend, Angular frontend, Azure Notification Hubs or SendGrid for emails.
- APIs for notification management.
- Security: Ensure notifications do not leak sensitive data.

Non-Functional Requirements:
- Notifications must be sent within 1 minute of event occurrence.
- System must support at least 10,000 notifications per day.
- Notification service must have 99.9% uptime.

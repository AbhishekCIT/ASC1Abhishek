User Story Title: As a business user, I want to schedule automated reports, so that I can receive updated data without manual intervention.

User Story Description: This feature will allow business users to set up recurring schedules for reports (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly) and have the reports automatically generated and delivered to their preferred channels (email, dashboard, etc.). The user interface should provide options to select report type, frequency, recipients, and delivery format.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Users can select a report and choose a scheduling frequency (daily, weekly, monthly, custom).
2. Users can specify delivery channels (email, dashboard, file export).
3. Users receive confirmation upon successful scheduling.
4. Scheduled reports are generated and delivered as per the defined schedule.
5. Users can view, edit, or delete existing schedules.

Validations:
1. Only authorized users can schedule reports.
2. Scheduling frequency must be valid (no overlapping/conflicting schedules).
3. Email addresses or delivery channels must be validated before saving the schedule.
4. Reports must be generated only if source data is available.

Business Logic: 
- On schedule creation, validate user permissions and scheduling parameters.
- Store scheduling metadata in the database.
- Use a background job scheduler (e.g., cron, Azure Functions Timer Trigger) to trigger report generation.
- Fetch and generate the report at the scheduled time.
- Deliver the report to the specified channels and log the delivery status.

Technical Context:
- Technology stack: .NET Core backend, Angular frontend, Azure SQL Database, Azure Functions for scheduling.
- APIs for report generation and delivery.
- Data formats: PDF, Excel, CSV.
- Security: Role-based access control, encrypted data transmission, audit logs.

Non-Functional Requirements:
- Reports must be delivered within 5 minutes of the scheduled time.
- System must support at least 1000 concurrent scheduled jobs.
- High availability (99.9% uptime) for scheduling service.
- Monitoring and alerting for failed report deliveries.
- GDPR-compliant data handling and user privacy.

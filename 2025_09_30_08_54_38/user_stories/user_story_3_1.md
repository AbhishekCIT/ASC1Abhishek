User Story Title: As a traveler, I want to book air transport tickets online, So that I can conveniently plan and purchase my travel in advance.

User Story Description: This feature allows travelers to search for available flights, compare options, and book tickets directly through the application. The system should support multiple airlines, display real-time availability, and provide a seamless booking experience.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Users can search for flights by origin, destination, and date.
2. Users can view a list of available flights with prices and timings.
3. Users can select a flight and proceed to booking.
4. Users receive a confirmation upon successful booking.

Validations:
1. Origin and destination fields must not be empty.
2. Date selected must not be in the past.
3. Payment details must be valid and authorized.

Business Logic: The system should query airline APIs for real-time flight data, filter results based on user input, and handle booking transactions securely. Booking confirmation numbers should be unique and stored in the user profile.

Technical Context: The application will use a modern web framework (e.g., React for frontend, Node.js for backend), integrate with airline APIs (REST/JSON), and use secure payment gateways. Data will be stored in a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL). Security via HTTPS and OAuth2 for authentication.

Non-Functional Requirements: The system must support 99.9% uptime, process bookings within 3 seconds, encrypt sensitive data, scale to handle peak loads, and log all transactions for audit and analytics.

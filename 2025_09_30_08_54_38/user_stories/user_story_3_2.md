EPIC Number: 3
User Story Number: 2
User Story Title: As a traveler, I want to track the real-time status of my flight, So that I can stay informed about delays, gate changes, or cancellations.

User Story Description: This feature enables users to enter their flight number or booking reference and receive up-to-date information regarding their flight status, including delays, estimated departure/arrival times, and gate assignments.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Users can search for flight status by flight number or booking reference.
2. The system displays real-time updates on flight status, delays, and gate changes.
3. Users receive notifications for any changes to their flight status.

Validations:
1. Flight number or booking reference must be valid and exist in the system.
2. User must be authenticated to receive notifications.
3. Data must be refreshed at least every 2 minutes.

Business Logic: The system should poll airline or airport APIs for real-time status updates, map updates to user bookings, and trigger notifications for any changes. Data should be cached for performance but refreshed frequently.

Technical Context: Integration with airline/airport APIs (REST/JSON), use of push notification services (e.g., Firebase), and secure user authentication. Data stored in a NoSQL cache for quick access.

Non-Functional Requirements: Status updates must be delivered within 1 minute of change, system must handle 10,000+ concurrent users, and notifications must be reliable and secure.

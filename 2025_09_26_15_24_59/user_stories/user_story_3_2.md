User Story Title: As a traveler, I want to view and manage my air transport bookings, So that I can keep track of my travel plans and make changes if needed.

User Story Description: This feature enables users to view their current and past bookings, access details such as flight times and seat numbers, and make modifications or cancellations. Users should be able to log in and securely access their booking history.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Users can log in and view a list of their bookings.
2. Users can see details for each booking (flight info, passenger details, payment status).
3. Users can modify or cancel bookings within allowed timeframes.

Validations:
1. Only authenticated users can access booking information.
2. Modifications/cancellations are allowed only before the airline's cutoff time.

Business Logic: Retrieve bookings from the database based on user ID, apply airline rules for modifications/cancellations, update booking status upon change, and trigger notifications.

Technical Context: Technology stack: .NET backend, React frontend, RESTful APIs for booking management, secure HTTPS, JWT authentication, JSON data format, integration with airline systems for real-time updates.

Non-Functional Requirements: Data privacy and encryption for user data, 99.9% uptime, audit logging for all changes, scalable to support thousands of users, monitoring for failed modification/cancellation attempts.

User Story Description: This user story covers the ability for travelers to search for available flights, compare options, and book air transport tickets through an online platform. The system should provide a user-friendly interface for searching flights based on origin, destination, date, and class, and enable secure payment and ticket confirmation.

2. Users can view available flight options with prices and timings.
3. Users can select a flight and proceed to booking.

- Integration with third-party flight APIs (e.g., Amadeus, Sabre)
- Payment gateway integration (e.g., Stripe, PayPal)
- Data formats: JSON for API communication

- 99.9% uptime for booking service.
- All sensitive data encrypted in transit and at rest.
- Booking confirmation within 5 seconds of payment.

User Story Title: As a traveler, I want to manage my air transport bookings online, so that I can view, modify, or cancel my reservations easily.

User Story Description: This user story enables users to access their existing bookings, view details, make changes such as rescheduling or upgrading seats, or cancel their reservations. The system should display booking history and provide options for modifications, subject to airline policies.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Users can log in and view their current and past bookings.
2. Users can modify booking details (dates, seats, passenger info) if allowed by policy.
3. Users can cancel bookings and receive confirmation and refund status.
4. System displays applicable fees or restrictions for changes/cancellations.

Validations:
1. Only authenticated users can access their bookings.
2. Modifications and cancellations must comply with airline rules.

Business Logic:
- Booking retrieval based on user authentication.
- Modification and cancellation logic checks airline policy, fare rules, and timing.
- Refund calculation based on fare type and time of cancellation.

Technical Context:
- Technology stack: ReactJS (frontend), NodeJS/Express (backend), PostgreSQL (database)
- Integration with airline APIs for booking management
- Secure user authentication (OAuth2)
- Data formats: JSON for API communication

User Story Title: As a business analyst, I want to configure automated report schedules, so that reports are generated and delivered at predefined intervals without manual intervention.

User Story Description: This feature enables users to set up schedules for automated report generation and delivery. Users can specify the frequency (daily, weekly, monthly), time, and recipients for each report. The system should support multiple scheduling options and allow users to manage (create, edit, delete) their scheduled reports easily.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Users can select a report and configure its schedule (frequency, time, recipients).
2. Scheduled reports are generated automatically at the specified intervals.
3. Reports are delivered to the specified recipients via email or other configured channels.
4. Users can view, edit, and delete existing schedules.
5. The system provides notifications for successful and failed report deliveries.

Validations:
1. Scheduling frequency must be valid (daily, weekly, monthly, custom).
2. Recipient email addresses must be validated before saving the schedule.
3. Report generation must succeed before delivery is attempted.
4. No duplicate schedules for the same report and recipient combination.

Business Logic: 
- When a user configures a schedule, the system stores the schedule parameters in the database.
- A background job checks for due schedules and triggers report generation.
- Upon successful generation, the report is sent to the recipients.
- If delivery fails, the system logs the failure and notifies the user.

Technical Context:
- Technology stack: .NET Core backend, Angular frontend, Azure SQL Database.
- Frameworks: Hangfire for background jobs, SendGrid for email delivery.
- API: RESTful endpoints for schedule management.
- Data formats: JSON for API communication, PDF/Excel for report output.
- Security: Role-based access control, encrypted storage of schedule data.

Non-Functional Requirements:
- Performance: Report scheduling and delivery should occur within 2 minutes of the scheduled time.
- Availability: 99.9% uptime for scheduling service.
- Security: All schedule data encrypted at rest and in transit.
- Scalability: Support up to 10,000 scheduled reports per day.
- Monitoring: Application Insights for job execution and delivery status.

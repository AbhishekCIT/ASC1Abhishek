User Story Title: As a traveler, I want to view and manage my air transport bookings, So that I can make changes or cancellations as needed.

User Story Description: This feature allows users to access their existing bookings, view details, and perform actions such as changing flight dates, updating passenger information, or cancelling bookings. The system should display all relevant booking information and provide clear options for modifications.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Users can view a list of their current and past bookings.
2. Users can modify booking details (e.g., date, passenger info) where permitted by airline policy.
3. Users can cancel bookings and receive confirmation.
4. Refunds are processed according to airline rules.

Validations:
1. Only bookings within the modification window can be changed.
2. Cancellation requests must match airline cancellation policies.
3. User authentication required before accessing booking details.

Business Logic: The system should fetch booking data from the airline or internal database, validate modification requests against airline policies, and process changes or cancellations. Refunds are calculated based on fare rules and processed through integrated payment systems.

Technical Context: Uses React for UI, Node.js backend, airline REST APIs for booking management, and secure user authentication (OAuth2). Data formats: JSON. Security: HTTPS, encrypted user data.

Non-Functional Requirements: Booking management actions must complete within 3 seconds, system must be available 99.9%, changes and cancellations must be logged, and sensitive data must be protected.

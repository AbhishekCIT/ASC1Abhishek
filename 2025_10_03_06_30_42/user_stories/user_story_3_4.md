User Story Title: As a traveler, I want to contact customer support for my air transport bookings, So that I can resolve issues or get assistance quickly.

User Story Description: This feature enables users to reach out to customer support through multiple channels (chat, email, phone) for help with booking issues, flight changes, cancellations, or complaints. The system should provide a user-friendly interface for submitting queries and tracking their resolution status.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Users can access customer support via chat, email, or phone.
2. Users receive a ticket number for each query submitted.
3. Users can track the status and resolution of their queries.
4. Support agents can access booking details to assist users.

Validations:
1. Only authenticated users can submit support requests related to bookings.
2. All queries must be logged and tracked until resolution.
3. Support responses must meet defined SLA times.

Business Logic: The system creates a support ticket for each user query, assigns it to an agent, and tracks progress until resolution. Agents can view booking details and update ticket status. Automated notifications are sent for status changes.

Technical Context: Uses Node.js backend, React frontend, integration with third-party support platforms (e.g., Zendesk), and secure user authentication. Data formats: JSON. Security: HTTPS, encrypted user data.

Non-Functional Requirements: Support requests must be acknowledged within 1 minute, system must be available 99.9%, ticket logs retained for 2 years, and all data transmissions must be secure.

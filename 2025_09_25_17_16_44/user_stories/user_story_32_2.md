User Story Title: As a business user, I want to manage my scheduled reports, so that I can update, pause, or cancel automated report deliveries as needed.

User Story Description: This feature will allow users to view a list of all their scheduled reports, edit the schedule or delivery options, temporarily pause a schedule, or delete a scheduled report. The user interface should provide clear options for these actions and confirmation prompts to avoid accidental changes.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Users can view all scheduled reports with details (report type, schedule, delivery method).
2. Users can edit scheduling parameters and delivery options.
3. Users can pause or resume a scheduled report.
4. Users can delete a scheduled report with a confirmation prompt.
5. Changes are reflected immediately in the system and audit logs.

Validations:
1. Only the owner or admin can modify a scheduled report.
2. Editing a schedule must not create conflicts with existing schedules.
3. Deleted schedules are removed from the active list and audit logged.

Business Logic:
- Editing updates the schedule in the scheduling engine.
- Pausing disables triggers without deleting the configuration.
- Deleting removes the schedule and cancels future deliveries.
- All actions are logged for audit purposes.

Technical Context:
- Technology Stack: .NET Core backend, Angular frontend
- APIs: RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations on schedules
- Data Formats: JSON for API communication
- Security: OAuth2 authentication, RBAC for permissions

Non-Functional Requirements:
- Performance: Updates to schedules should reflect within 5 seconds.
- Availability: 99.9% uptime for schedule management service.
- Security: All changes logged and auditable.
- Scalability: Support for concurrent schedule modifications by 1000+ users.
- Monitoring: Alerts for failed schedule updates or deletions.

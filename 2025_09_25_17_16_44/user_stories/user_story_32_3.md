User Story Number: 3
User Story Title: As a business user, I want to configure notification preferences for scheduled reports, so that I am informed of successful deliveries or failures in my preferred way.

User Story Description: This feature will allow users to set preferences for how they receive notifications about scheduled report deliveries (e.g., email, SMS, in-app notification). Users can also opt to receive alerts for failed report generations or deliveries, ensuring they are aware of any issues promptly.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Users can select notification channels for each scheduled report.
2. Users receive notifications on successful report delivery.
3. Users receive alerts for failed report generation or delivery.
4. Notification settings can be updated at any time.
5. All notifications are logged for reference.

Validations:
1. Notification channels must be valid and verified (e.g., email address, phone number).
2. Users must have the option to opt-in/opt-out of specific notifications.
3. System must not send duplicate notifications for a single event.

Business Logic:
- Notification service checks user preferences before sending.
- On failure, system retries delivery and sends alert if unsuccessful.
- All notification events are logged.

Technical Context:
- Technology Stack: .NET Core backend, Angular frontend
- Frameworks: SendGrid for email, Twilio for SMS, SignalR for in-app notifications
- APIs: RESTful APIs for notification management
- Data Formats: JSON for API, email/SMS formats for delivery
- Security: Secure storage of notification preferences, encrypted channels

Non-Functional Requirements:
- Performance: Notifications sent within 30 seconds of event.
- Availability: 99.9% uptime for notification service.
- Security: Notification data encrypted in transit and at rest.
- Scalability: Support for 100,000+ notifications per day.
- Monitoring: Real-time monitoring and alerting for notification failures.

User Story Title: As a business user, I want to schedule automated reports, so that I can receive timely insights without manual intervention.

User Story Description: This feature will allow business users to configure and schedule recurring reports to be generated and delivered automatically at specified intervals (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.). The user can select the report type, set the schedule, and choose delivery methods (email, download link, etc.).

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Users can select a report and set a schedule (frequency, time, start/end date).
2. Users can specify delivery methods (email, in-app notification, etc.).
3. System generates and delivers reports as per the schedule.
4. Users receive confirmation of scheduled reports.
5. Users can view, edit, or delete scheduled reports.

Validations:
1. Schedule must not overlap for the same report and user.
2. Email addresses must be valid if email delivery is chosen.
3. Only authorized users can schedule reports.

Business Logic: 
- Scheduling engine triggers report generation at defined intervals.
- Delivery module sends reports via selected channels.
- Audit logs are maintained for all scheduled actions.
- Pseudocode:
  IF schedule_time == current_time THEN
    generate_report()
    deliver_report()
    log_action()

Technical Context:
- Technology Stack: .NET Core backend, Angular frontend
- Frameworks: Quartz.NET for scheduling, SendGrid for email
- APIs: RESTful APIs for scheduling and report management
- Data Formats: JSON for API, PDF/Excel for reports
- Security: OAuth2 authentication, role-based access control

Non-Functional Requirements:
- Performance: Reports must be generated within 2 minutes of scheduled time.
- Availability: 99.9% uptime for scheduling service.
- Security: Data encryption in transit and at rest.
- Scalability: Support for 10,000+ scheduled reports per day.
- Monitoring: Centralized logging and alerting for failures.

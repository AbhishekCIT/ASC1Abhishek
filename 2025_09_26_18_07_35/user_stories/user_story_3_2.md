User Story Title: As a traveler, I want to view and manage my air transport bookings, So that I can make changes or cancellations as needed.

User Story Description: This feature enables users to access their existing bookings, view details, and modify or cancel reservations. The system should authenticate users and provide options to update passenger information, change flights, or cancel bookings with appropriate refund policies.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Users can log in and view a list of their bookings.
2. Users can select a booking to view details.
3. Users can modify passenger information or flight details.
4. Users can cancel bookings and receive refund information.

Validations:
1. Validate user authentication before showing bookings.
2. Validate changes against airline policies (e.g., change/cancellation fees).
3. Validate refund calculations as per policy.

Business Logic: The system should fetch booking data from the database, allow permitted changes, interact with airline APIs for modifications, and process cancellations with refund calculations. All changes should be logged for audit purposes.

Technical Context: Technology stack includes React, Node.js, secure authentication (OAuth 2.0), RESTful API integration with airlines, and secure handling of user data. Data format is JSON, communication over HTTPS.

Non-Functional Requirements: System should ensure data integrity, support high concurrency, provide secure access, and maintain audit logs for all changes and cancellations.

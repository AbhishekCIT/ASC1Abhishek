User Story Title: As an administrator, I want to manage user permissions for scheduling automated reports, so that only authorized users can create, edit, or view scheduled reports.

User Story Description: This feature enables administrators to assign or revoke permissions for scheduling, editing, pausing, or viewing automated reports. Permissions can be managed at the user or role level, ensuring compliance with organizational policies and data security requirements.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Administrators can assign report scheduling permissions to users or roles.
2. Only users with appropriate permissions can access scheduling features.
3. Unauthorized users are prevented from creating, editing, or viewing scheduled reports.
4. Permission changes take effect immediately.

Validations:
1. Permission checks are enforced on all scheduling-related endpoints.
2. Permission assignments and changes are logged for auditing.
3. Users are notified if their permissions change.

Business Logic:
- Store permissions in the database at user or role level.
- Enforce permission checks in backend APIs and frontend UI.
- Log all permission changes and access attempts.
- Notify users of permission changes via email or in-app notification.

Technical Context:
- Technology stack: .NET Core backend, Angular frontend, SQL Server database.
- Integration with existing identity and access management (IAM) system.
- Security: RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) implementation.

Non-Functional Requirements:
- Permission changes must propagate within 1 minute.
- All permission assignments and access attempts must be auditable.
- System must support at least 10,000 users with role-based permissions.
- No unauthorized access to scheduling features or data.

User Story Title: As a business user, I want to schedule automated reports, so that I can receive updated information at regular intervals without manual intervention.

User Story Description: This feature allows business users to set up recurring schedules for generating and sending reports automatically. Users can select the report, define the frequency (daily, weekly, monthly), set the time, and choose delivery methods (email, download link, etc.). The system should handle report generation and delivery based on the defined schedule.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Users can select any available report for scheduling.
2. Users can define the frequency and time for report generation.
3. Users can specify one or more delivery methods (e.g., email, download link).
4. The system generates and delivers reports according to the schedule.
5. Users receive notifications upon successful or failed report delivery.

Validations:
1. Only valid report templates can be scheduled.
2. Scheduling frequency and time must be within allowed parameters.
3. Delivery methods must be valid and verified (e.g., valid email address).

Business Logic: 
- When a schedule is created, store the configuration in the database.
- Use a scheduler (e.g., cron job) to trigger report generation.
- On trigger, generate the report using the latest data.
- Deliver the report via the chosen method(s).
- Log success or failure and notify the user accordingly.

Technical Context: 
- Technology stack: .NET Core backend, Angular frontend, SQL Server database.
- Scheduler: Quartz.NET or Azure Functions Timer Trigger.
- Email delivery: SMTP integration.
- Security: Scheduled tasks must be authenticated and authorized; sensitive data in reports must be encrypted during delivery.

Non-Functional Requirements:
- Reports must be generated and delivered within 5 minutes of the scheduled time.
- The scheduling system must support at least 1,000 concurrent schedules.
- All scheduling and delivery activities must be logged for auditing.
- System must be available 99.9% of the time.
- Delivery failures must trigger retry logic and alert support if not resolved after 3 attempts.

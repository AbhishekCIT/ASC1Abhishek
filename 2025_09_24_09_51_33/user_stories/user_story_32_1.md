User Story Title: As a business user, I want to schedule automated reports, so that I can receive up-to-date data without manual intervention.

User Story Description: This feature allows business users to set up recurring schedules for generating and distributing reports automatically. Users can select report types, frequency (daily, weekly, monthly), recipients, and preferred formats (PDF, Excel, etc.). The system should generate the report as per the schedule and deliver it via email or to a specified location.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Users can select any available report for scheduling.
2. Users can specify the frequency (daily, weekly, monthly, custom).
3. Users can define one or more recipients for the report.
4. Reports are generated and delivered automatically as per the schedule.
5. Users receive notifications upon successful or failed report delivery.

Validations:
1. Only valid email addresses are accepted for recipients.
2. Scheduling is not allowed for reports with missing required parameters.
3. Duplicate schedules for the same report and time are prevented.

Business Logic: 
- When a user creates a schedule, validate all inputs.
- Store the schedule in the database with all parameters.
- At the scheduled time, trigger the report generation engine.
- If successful, send the report to all recipients.
- Log all activities and errors for auditing.

Technical Context: 
- Technology Stack: .NET Core backend, Angular frontend, SQL Server database.
- Use Quartz.NET for scheduling jobs.
- Email delivery via SMTP or integration with Microsoft Exchange API.
- Reports generated using SSRS or Power BI Embedded.
- Data formats: PDF, XLSX, CSV.
- Security: Role-based access control, encrypted storage of schedules and report data.

Non-Functional Requirements:
- Reports must be delivered within 5 minutes of the scheduled time.
- System must support at least 1000 concurrent schedules.
- All report data must be encrypted in transit and at rest.
- Monitoring and alerting for failed report deliveries.
- Audit logs for all scheduling and delivery activities.

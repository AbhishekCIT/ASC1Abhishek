EPIC Number: 3
User Story Number: 5
User Story Title: As a user, I want to use keyboard shortcuts to operate the calculator, so that I can perform calculations efficiently without using a mouse.

User Story Description: This user story ensures that all calculator functions are accessible via keyboard shortcuts, improving accessibility for power users and those with disabilities. Users should be able to input numbers, select operations, and execute calculations using only the keyboard.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Users can navigate between input fields and buttons using the Tab key.
2. Standard keyboard shortcuts are supported (e.g., Enter for calculate, Esc for clear, +, -, *, / for operations).
3. All calculator functions are accessible without a mouse.
4. Keyboard focus indicators are visible for all interactive elements.

Validations:
1. All interactive elements are reachable and usable via keyboard.
2. Keyboard shortcuts trigger the correct actions.
3. No keyboard traps or inaccessible elements exist.

Business Logic:
- Map keyboard events to calculator functions.
- Ensure focus management for accessibility.
- Pseudocode:
  onKeyDown(event):
      if event.key in ['+', '-', '*', '/']:
          selectOperation(event.key)
      if event.key == 'Enter':
          performCalculation()
      if event.key == 'Escape':
          clearInputs()

Technical Context:
- Technology stack: React (frontend), JavaScript event listeners.
- No backend required.
- Data format: Internal state only.
- Security: Prevent unintended actions from keyboard input.

Non-Functional Requirements:
- Performance: Keyboard actions must be processed instantly (<50ms).
- Availability: 99.9% uptime.
- Security: Prevent keyboard event injection.
- Scalability: Support all users concurrently.
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for keyboard navigation.
- Analytics: Track usage of keyboard shortcuts.
- Monitoring: Log keyboard-related errors.

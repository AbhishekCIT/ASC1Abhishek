EPIC Number: 3
User Story Number: 4
User Story Title: As a user, I want to view a history of my recent calculations, so that I can refer back to previous results without re-entering data.

User Story Description: This user story enables users to see a list of their recent calculations, including inputs, operations, and results. The history should be easily accessible and allow users to clear it if desired.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. A calculation history section is visible on the calculator interface.
2. Each entry in the history shows the two inputs, the operation, and the result.
3. Users can clear the calculation history with a single action.
4. The most recent calculation appears at the top of the history.

Validations:
1. Only valid completed calculations are added to the history.
2. Clearing the history removes all entries and resets the display.
3. History persists during the session but resets on page reload unless persistent storage is implemented.

Business Logic:
- After each calculation, append the operation and result to a history array.
- Display the history array in reverse chronological order.
- Provide a clear history button to empty the array.
- Pseudocode:
  onCalculate():
      history.unshift({input1, operation, input2, result})
  onClearHistory():
      history = []

Technical Context:
- Technology stack: React (frontend), local state or browser localStorage for persistence.
- No backend required unless persistent history is needed.
- Data format: Array of objects (JSON).
- Security: No sensitive data stored; clear on logout or session end.

Non-Functional Requirements:
- Performance: History updates instantly (<100ms).
- Availability: 99.9% uptime.
- Security: No sensitive data; clear on session end.
- Scalability: Support up to 100 history entries per user.
- Analytics: Track usage of history feature.
- Monitoring: Log errors related to history management.

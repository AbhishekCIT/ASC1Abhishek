EPIC Number: 3
User Story Number: 1
User Story Title: As a user, I want to perform basic arithmetic operations, so that I can quickly calculate results for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

User Story Description: This user story covers the core functionality of the calculator, allowing users to input two numbers and select an arithmetic operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide) to receive the correct result. The interface should be intuitive and responsive, supporting both mouse and keyboard input.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. User can input two numbers.
2. User can select an operation: add, subtract, multiply, or divide.
3. The correct result is displayed after the operation is performed.
4. Division by zero is handled gracefully with an error message.
5. The calculator UI is responsive and accessible.

Validations:
1. Only valid numbers are accepted as input.
2. Division by zero triggers an appropriate error message.
3. Inputs are cleared after each calculation if the user chooses to reset.

Business Logic: 
- Accept two numeric inputs.
- Perform the selected arithmetic operation using standard mathematical rules.
- If division is selected and the second number is zero, display an error message instead of a result.
- Pseudocode:
  if operation == 'divide' and num2 == 0:
      display 'Error: Division by zero'
  else:
      result = perform_operation(num1, num2, operation)
      display result

Technical Context:
- Technology stack: React (frontend), Node.js (backend, if needed), HTML5, CSS3
- No external API required; all calculations are client-side.
- Data format: JSON for any internal state management.
- Security: Input sanitization to prevent code injection.

Non-Functional Requirements:
- Performance: Results must be displayed within 200ms of user action.
- Availability: 99.9% uptime for the web application.
- Security: Prevent XSS and injection attacks via input validation.
- Scalability: Should handle at least 1000 concurrent users.
- Analytics: Track usage of each operation for future improvements.
- Monitoring: Log errors and user actions for debugging and analytics.

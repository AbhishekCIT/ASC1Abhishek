EPIC Number: 3
User Story Number: 2
User Story Title: As a user, I want to clear the calculator input, so that I can easily reset and start a new calculation without refreshing the page.

User Story Description: This user story ensures that users can clear all input fields and results with a single action, improving usability and reducing errors from leftover data.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. A clear/reset button is available on the calculator interface.
2. Clicking the clear button resets both input fields and the result display.
3. The calculator is ready for a new calculation after clearing.

Validations:
1. All input fields and result areas are emptied after clearing.
2. No residual data remains in the calculator state.

Business Logic:
- On clear button click, set all input fields and result variables to empty or default values.
- Pseudocode:
  onClearButtonClick():
      input1 = ''
      input2 = ''
      result = ''

Technical Context:
- Technology stack: React (frontend), Node.js (backend, if needed)
- No API required; all logic is client-side.
- Data format: Internal state management only.
- Security: No additional security considerations for this feature.

Non-Functional Requirements:
- Performance: Clearing action must complete instantly (<100ms).
- Availability: 99.9% uptime.
- Security: No sensitive data handled.
- Scalability: Should work for all users concurrently.
- Analytics: Track usage of the clear button.
- Monitoring: Log clear actions for analytics.

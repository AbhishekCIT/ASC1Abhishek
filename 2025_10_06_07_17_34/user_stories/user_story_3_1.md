User Story Title: As a passenger, I want to book air transport tickets online, So that I can conveniently plan and purchase my travel.

User Story Description: This user story covers the ability for passengers to search for available flights, compare options, and book tickets through an online platform. The feature should allow users to enter travel details (origin, destination, dates, number of passengers), view available flights, select preferred options, and complete the booking process with payment.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Users can search for flights by entering origin, destination, and travel dates.
2. Users can view a list of available flights with details (airline, departure/arrival times, price, etc.).
3. Users can select a flight and proceed to booking.
4. Users can enter passenger details and payment information securely.
5. Users receive a booking confirmation and e-ticket via email.

Validations:
1. Origin and destination fields must not be empty and must be valid airport codes.
2. Travel dates must be in the future and valid.
3. Payment information must be validated for correctness and security.

Business Logic: The system should query available flights from airline APIs or internal databases, filter results based on user input, and handle booking transactions securely. Upon successful payment, the system should generate a booking record and send confirmation to the user.

Technical Context: The platform will use a web application built with React (frontend) and Node.js/Express (backend). Flight data will be fetched via REST APIs from airline partners or a central GDS (Global Distribution System). Payment processing will be integrated with a PCI-compliant payment gateway. Data will be stored in a secure SQL database. All data transmissions will use HTTPS.

Non-Functional Requirements: The system must support at least 1000 concurrent users, provide 99.9% uptime, encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit, and log all booking transactions for audit purposes. The booking process should complete within 5 seconds under normal load.

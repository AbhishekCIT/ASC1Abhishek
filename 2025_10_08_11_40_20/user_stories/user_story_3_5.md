EPIC Number: 3
User Story Number: 5
User Story Title: As a user, I want to use keyboard shortcuts for calculator operations, so that I can perform calculations more efficiently without using the mouse.

User Story Description: This feature allows users to interact with the calculator using keyboard keys for numbers, operations, and actions (e.g., Enter for equals, Esc for clear). Keyboard accessibility should be intuitive and follow standard calculator conventions.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Users can input numbers using the keyboard.
2. Users can perform operations (+, -, *, /) using keyboard keys.
3. Enter key triggers calculation; Esc key clears input.
4. All calculator functions are accessible via keyboard.

Validations:
1. Keyboard input is mapped correctly to calculator functions.
2. No conflicts with browser or OS shortcuts.
3. Keyboard navigation works across all supported browsers.

Business Logic:
- Listen for keypress events and map to calculator actions.
- Prevent default browser behavior if necessary (e.g., Enter, Esc).
- Provide visual feedback when keyboard shortcuts are used.

Technical Context:
- Technology stack: React (frontend), JavaScript/TypeScript.
- Use event listeners for keyboard input.
- Accessibility: Ensure compliance with WCAG for keyboard navigation.

Non-Functional Requirements:
- Performance: No perceptible delay in response to keyboard input.
- Accessibility: Fully keyboard navigable and screen-reader compatible.
- Usability: Document available shortcuts in the UI or help section.

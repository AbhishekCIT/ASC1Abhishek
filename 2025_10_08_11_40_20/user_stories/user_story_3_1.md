EPIC Number: 3
User Story Number: 1
User Story Title: As a user, I want to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), so that I can quickly calculate results for simple math problems.

User Story Description: This feature will allow users to input two or more numbers and select an arithmetic operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide). The calculator will display the result immediately after the operation is performed. The interface should be intuitive and responsive, supporting both keyboard and mouse input.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. User can input numbers using keyboard or on-screen buttons.
2. User can select an operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide).
3. Calculator displays the correct result after the operation.
4. Handles division by zero gracefully with an error message.
5. Supports both integer and decimal numbers.

Validations:
1. Only valid numerical input is accepted.
2. Division by zero triggers an error message and does not crash the application.
3. Results are rounded to a reasonable number of decimal places (e.g., 2).

Business Logic: 
- Parse user input for valid numbers.
- Map operation buttons to arithmetic functions.
- Perform the calculation based on user selection.
- Handle exceptions such as division by zero.
- Display the result in the output area.

Technical Context:
- Technology stack: React (frontend), Node.js (backend, if needed), HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript/TypeScript.
- No external API required for basic operations.
- Data format: JSON for any internal data passing.
- Security: Input validation to prevent code injection.

Non-Functional Requirements:
- Performance: Calculation and result display must be instantaneous (<100ms).
- Availability: 99.9% uptime for web-based calculator.
- Security: Sanitize all user inputs.
- Scalability: Should support at least 1000 concurrent users.
- Analytics: Track usage count of each operation for product improvement.
- Monitoring: Log errors and exceptions for troubleshooting.

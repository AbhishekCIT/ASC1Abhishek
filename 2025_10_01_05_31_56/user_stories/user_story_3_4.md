User Story Title: As a traveler, I want to check in online for my flight, So that I can save time and avoid queues at the airport.

User Story Description: This feature enables travelers to complete the check-in process online, select seats, and obtain a digital boarding pass. The system should support check-in windows as per airline policies and integrate with airline systems for seat assignment and boarding pass generation.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Users can check in online within the allowed window before departure.
2. Users can select available seats during check-in.
3. Digital boarding pass is generated and sent to the user.
4. System displays airline-specific check-in rules.

Validations:
1. Validate user eligibility for online check-in (timing, ticket type).
2. Ensure seat selection is within available options.
3. Confirm boarding pass is generated only after successful check-in.

Business Logic: The system must verify check-in eligibility, interact with airline APIs for seat assignment, and generate a digital boarding pass. Pseudocode:
- Authenticate user
- Check eligibility
- Select seat
- Confirm check-in
- Generate boarding pass

Technical Context: Technology stack: ReactJS (frontend), Node.js (backend), RESTful APIs for airline check-in, PostgreSQL for user data, integration with email/SMS for boarding pass delivery. Data format: JSON. Security: SSL/TLS, user authentication.

Non-Functional Requirements: Check-in process <2min, 99.9% uptime, secure data handling, scalable to 10,000 concurrent users, audit logging for check-in actions, analytics for check-in rates.

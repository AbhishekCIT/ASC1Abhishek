User Story Title: As a traveler, I want to manage my air transport bookings, So that I can view, modify, or cancel my reservations easily.

User Story Description: This feature enables travelers to access their booking history, view current reservations, make changes (such as seat selection or passenger details), and cancel bookings if needed. The system should ensure that modifications and cancellations adhere to airline policies and refund rules.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Users can view all current and past bookings.
2. Users can modify booking details (where allowed by airline).
3. Users can cancel bookings and receive applicable refunds.
4. System displays airline-specific rules for changes and cancellations.
5. Confirmation of changes/cancellations is sent via email/SMS.

Validations:
1. Validate user authentication before allowing access to bookings.
2. Ensure modifications are allowed only within airline policy limits.
3. Refund calculations are accurate and displayed before confirmation.

Business Logic: The system must fetch booking data from the database, check airline rules for modifications/cancellations, and process refunds as per policy. Pseudocode:
- Authenticate user
- Fetch bookings
- Allow modification/cancellation
- Apply airline rules
- Process refund (if applicable)
- Send confirmation

Technical Context: Technology stack: ReactJS (frontend), Node.js (backend), RESTful APIs for airline rules, PostgreSQL for bookings, integration with payment gateway for refunds. Data format: JSON. Security: OAuth2 authentication, SSL/TLS.

Non-Functional Requirements: Response time <2s for booking management, 99.9% uptime, secure access control, scalable to 10,000 concurrent users, audit logging for changes/cancellations, analytics for booking modifications.

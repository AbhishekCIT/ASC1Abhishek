User Story Title: As a traveler, I want to check the real-time status of my flight, So that I can stay informed about any delays or changes.

User Story Description: This feature allows travelers to view the current status of their booked flights, including departure/arrival times, gate information, delays, and cancellations. The system should provide push notifications for status changes and integrate with airline APIs for real-time updates.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Users can search for flight status by flight number or booking reference.
2. Users receive real-time updates for delays, gate changes, or cancellations.
3. Push notifications are sent for status changes.
4. Flight status information is accurate and up-to-date.

Validations:
1. Validate flight number or booking reference input.
2. Ensure status data is fetched from reliable airline sources.
3. Confirm notifications are sent to the correct user/device.

Business Logic: The system must poll airline APIs for status updates, match flights to user bookings, and trigger notifications for relevant changes. Pseudocode:
- Input flight number/reference
- Fetch status from airline API
- Display status
- If status changes, send notification

Technical Context: Technology stack: React Native (mobile), Node.js (backend), RESTful APIs for airline status, Firebase for push notifications. Data format: JSON. Security: SSL/TLS, user authentication for notifications.

Non-Functional Requirements: Real-time status updates (<1min latency), 99.9% uptime, secure data transmission, scalable to 10,000 concurrent users, monitoring for API failures, analytics for notification delivery.

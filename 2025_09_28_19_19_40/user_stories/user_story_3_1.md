User Story Title: As a traveler, I want to book air transport tickets online, So that I can conveniently plan my journey.

User Story Description: This user story covers the ability for travelers to search for flights, view available options, and book air transport tickets through the application. The feature should support searching by origin, destination, date, and class of service, and allow secure payment processing.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. User can search for flights by entering origin, destination, and travel dates.
2. System displays available flights with details (airline, timings, price, class).
3. User can select a flight and proceed to booking.
4. Payment can be made securely online.
5. Booking confirmation is displayed and sent via email.

Validations:
1. Origin and destination must be valid airport codes or names.
2. Travel dates must be in the future.
3. Payment details must be validated for correctness and security.

Business Logic: The system should query available flights from airline APIs, filter results based on user input, calculate total price (including taxes/fees), and process payment securely. Upon successful booking, generate a unique booking reference and trigger confirmation email.

Technical Context: Use a web framework (e.g., React for frontend, Node.js/Express for backend), integrate with airline APIs (REST/JSON), use secure payment gateway (PCI DSS compliant), store bookings in a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL), and ensure HTTPS for all transactions.

Non-Functional Requirements: 
- Response time for search should be <2 seconds.
- System should be available 99.9% of the time.
- All personal and payment data must be encrypted at rest and in transit.
- Support at least 10,000 concurrent users.
- Log all transactions for audit and monitoring.

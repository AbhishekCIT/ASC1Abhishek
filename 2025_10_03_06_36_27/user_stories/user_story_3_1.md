User Story Title: As a traveler, I want to book air transport tickets online, So that I can conveniently plan and purchase my travel from anywhere.

User Story Description: This user story covers the ability for end-users (travelers) to search for available air transport options, compare prices, select flights, and complete the booking process through an online platform. The feature should support multiple airlines, various payment methods, and provide confirmation and itinerary details upon successful booking.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Users can search for flights based on origin, destination, and travel dates.
2. Users can view available flights, prices, and airline details.
3. Users can select a flight and proceed to booking.
4. Users can enter passenger details and choose payment options.
5. Users receive a booking confirmation and itinerary via email and on the platform.

Validations:
1. All required fields (origin, destination, dates, passenger info) must be filled before proceeding.
2. Payment information must be validated for correctness and authorization.
3. Booking confirmation must only be generated for successful transactions.

Business Logic: 
- Search algorithm must query multiple airline APIs for real-time availability and pricing.
- Booking engine must reserve seats and process payments atomically to avoid overbooking.
- Confirmation and itinerary generation must be triggered only after payment success.

Technical Context:
- Technology stack: ReactJS (frontend), Node.js/Express (backend), PostgreSQL (database).
- Integrations: Airline APIs (REST/GraphQL), Payment Gateway APIs (PCI-compliant), Email service (SMTP/API).
- Data formats: JSON for API communication, HTTPS for secure data transfer.
- Security: OAuth2 for user authentication, TLS encryption, PCI DSS compliance for payments.

Non-Functional Requirements:
- System must support 1000+ concurrent users with <2s response time for search.
- 99.9% uptime required, with automated failover and backup.
- All sensitive data must be encrypted at rest and in transit.
- Audit logs for all booking and payment activities.
- Real-time monitoring and alerting for API failures and performance bottlenecks.

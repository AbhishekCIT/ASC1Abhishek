User Story Title: As a traveler, I want to view and manage my air transport bookings, So that I can review, update, or cancel my reservations as needed.

User Story Description: This user story covers the ability for users to access their existing bookings, view details, make changes such as seat selection or meal preferences, and initiate cancellations or rescheduling. The feature should provide clear options, display applicable fees, and ensure all changes are reflected in real time.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Users can log in and view a list of their current and past bookings.
2. Users can select a booking to view detailed information (flight, passenger, payment, etc.).
3. Users can update preferences (seats, meals) where allowed by the airline.
4. Users can initiate cancellation or rescheduling and see applicable fees/refunds.
5. Users receive confirmation of any changes via email and on the platform.

Validations:
1. Only authenticated users can access their bookings.
2. Changes are only allowed if permitted by the airline fare rules.

Technical Context:
- Technology stack: ReactJS (frontend), Node.js/Express (backend), PostgreSQL (database).
- Integrations: Airline APIs for booking management, Payment Gateway for refunds.
- Data formats: JSON for API communication.

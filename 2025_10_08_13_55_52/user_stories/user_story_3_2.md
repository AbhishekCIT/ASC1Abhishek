User Story Title: As a traveler, I want to manage my air transport bookings, So that I can view, modify, or cancel my reservations easily.

User Story Description: This feature enables users to view their current and past bookings, make changes to their reservations (such as date or seat selection), and cancel bookings if needed. The system should provide clear options and confirmations for each action.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Users can view all their bookings in one place.
2. Users can modify booking details (date, seat, passenger info).
3. Users can cancel bookings and receive confirmation.

Validations:
1. Only bookings within the allowed modification window can be changed.
2. Cancellation policies must be enforced.
3. User authentication required for booking management.

Business Logic: The system should check airline rules for modifications/cancellations, update booking records, and trigger refunds if applicable. Pseudocode:
- Input: booking ID, modification/cancellation request
- Validate request
- Update booking via airline API
- Notify user

Technical Context: Technology stack: ReactJS frontend, Node.js backend, airline RESTful APIs, secure user authentication, JSON data format, HTTPS.

Non-Functional Requirements: Booking updates within 3 seconds, 99.9% uptime, secure access, audit logging, monitoring via Azure Application Insights.

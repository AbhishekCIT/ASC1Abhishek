EPIC Number: 32
User Story Number: 4
User Story Title: As a compliance officer, I want all report scheduling actions to be logged, So that we can audit and review scheduling activities for security and compliance.

User Story Description: This user story covers the requirement to log all actions related to report scheduling, including creation, modification, deletion, and execution of schedules. Logs should capture user ID, timestamp, action type, and affected schedule details. The purpose is to ensure traceability and support regulatory compliance.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. All scheduling actions (create, edit, delete, execute) are logged with user ID and timestamp.
2. Logs are accessible to compliance officers via a secure interface.
3. Logs are retained for a configurable period (e.g., 1 year).
4. Logs cannot be altered by end users.

Validations:
1. Each log entry must contain user ID, action type, timestamp, and schedule details.
2. Only authorized compliance officers can access logs.
3. Log retention policy must be enforced.

Business Logic: On every scheduling action, create a log entry in the audit log database. Provide a secure API for compliance officers to query logs. Pseudocode:
ON schedule_action (create/edit/delete/execute) DO
    CREATE log_entry (user_id, action_type, timestamp, schedule_details)

Technical Context: Technology stack: .NET Core backend, Azure SQL for audit logs, Angular frontend for compliance UI. Security: Logs are encrypted and access is restricted via role-based access control. Data format: JSON for API, encrypted storage for logs.

Non-Functional Requirements:
- Performance: Logging must not delay scheduling actions by more than 500ms.
- Availability: Audit log service must be available 99.99% of the time.
- Security: Logs are encrypted and access is strictly controlled.
- Retention: Logs are retained for at least 1 year.
- Monitoring: All access to logs is monitored and alerts are triggered for unauthorized access attempts.

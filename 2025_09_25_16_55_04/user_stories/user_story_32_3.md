User Story Title: As a user, I want to receive notifications when scheduled reports are generated or if there is a failure, So that I am always informed about the status of my reports.

User Story Description: This user story covers the requirement for users to receive email or in-app notifications when a scheduled report is successfully generated or if there is an error/failure in the process. Notifications should include relevant details such as report name, time, and error information (if applicable).

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Users receive an email notification when a report is generated.
2. Users receive an email notification if report generation fails, with error details.
3. Notifications are sent to all designated recipients.
4. Notification content includes report name, generation time, and status.

Validations:
1. Email addresses must be valid and verified.
2. Notification must be sent within 1 minute of report generation or failure.
3. Notification content must match the scheduled report details.

Business Logic: When a report is generated, trigger a notification workflow. If the report fails, capture the error and send a failure notification. Pseudocode:
IF report_generation_success THEN
    SEND success notification
ELSE
    SEND failure notification with error details

Technical Context: Technology stack: .NET Core backend, Azure Functions for notification workflow, SendGrid for email delivery. Data format: JSON for notification payload. Security: Only authorized users receive notifications.

Non-Functional Requirements:
- Performance: Notifications must be sent within 1 minute.
- Availability: Notification service must be available 99.9% of the time.
- Security: Only authenticated users can receive notifications.
- Monitoring: All notifications and failures must be logged and monitored.

User Story Title: As a business analyst, I want to define automated report scheduling rules, So that users can receive reports at their preferred intervals without manual intervention.

User Story Description: This user story focuses on the ability for business analysts or admin users to configure scheduling rules for automated reports. The feature should allow specification of frequency (daily, weekly, monthly), time of delivery, and selection of report types. The purpose is to streamline report distribution and reduce manual effort.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. User can select report type for scheduling.
2. User can specify frequency (daily, weekly, monthly) and time for report delivery.
3. User can activate, deactivate, or edit scheduling rules.
4. System validates scheduling parameters before saving.
5. Scheduled reports are delivered as per defined rules.

Validations:
1. Frequency must be one of the allowed values (daily, weekly, monthly).
2. Time must be in valid 24-hour format.
3. Report type must exist in the system.
4. Scheduling rule must not conflict with existing rules for the same report.

Business Logic: When a scheduling rule is created, the system stores the configuration and sets up background jobs to trigger report generation and delivery at specified intervals. Editing or deactivating a rule updates or cancels the corresponding jobs. Pseudocode:
- On rule creation: Validate inputs, store rule, schedule job.
- On rule edit: Validate, update rule, reschedule job.
- On rule deactivate: Cancel scheduled job.

Technical Context: Technology stack: .NET Core backend, Angular frontend, Azure SQL Database, Azure Functions for scheduling jobs. API endpoints for CRUD operations on scheduling rules. Security: RBAC for access to scheduling features. Data format: JSON for API payloads.

Non-Functional Requirements:
- Performance: Scheduling rule creation/edit should complete within 2 seconds.
- Availability: Feature available 99.9% uptime.
- Security: Only authorized users can manage scheduling rules.
- Scalability: Support up to 10,000 concurrent scheduling rules.
- Monitoring: Audit logs for rule changes, job execution status tracked in Azure Monitor.

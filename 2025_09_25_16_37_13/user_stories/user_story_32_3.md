EPIC Number: 32
User Story Number: 3
User Story Title: As an administrator, I want to monitor and audit scheduled report jobs, So that I can ensure reports are delivered as expected and troubleshoot any failures.

User Story Description: This user story covers the need for administrators to view logs and statuses of scheduled report jobs. The feature should provide a dashboard with job history, delivery status, error logs, and the ability to re-run failed jobs. This ensures reliability and accountability in report delivery.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Administrator can view a dashboard of all scheduled report jobs.
2. Dashboard displays job status (success, failure, pending).
3. Error logs are available for failed jobs.
4. Administrator can manually re-run failed jobs.
5. Audit trail is maintained for all job executions.

Validations:
1. Only users with admin role can access the monitoring dashboard.
2. Audit logs must include timestamp, user, report type, and status.
3. Re-run action must be logged and tracked.

Business Logic: The system logs every scheduled job execution with relevant details. On failure, error information is captured and displayed. Administrators can trigger a re-run, which is logged for audit purposes. Pseudocode:
- On job execution: Log status, details, errors if any.
- On dashboard load: Fetch job history, display statuses.
- On re-run: Trigger job, log action.

Technical Context: Technology stack: .NET Core backend, Angular frontend, Azure Monitor and Application Insights for logging, Azure Functions for job execution. API endpoints for job history and audit logs. Security: RBAC for dashboard access.

Non-Functional Requirements:
- Performance: Dashboard loads within 3 seconds for up to 10,000 jobs.
- Availability: Monitoring system available 99.9% uptime.
- Security: Audit data protected and accessible only to admins.
- Scalability: Support up to 1 million job logs.
- Monitoring: Real-time alerts for job failures.

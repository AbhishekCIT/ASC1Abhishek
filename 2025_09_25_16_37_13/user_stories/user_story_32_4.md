User Story Title: As a user, I want to be notified when a scheduled report fails to generate or deliver, So that I can take corrective action or request support promptly.

User Story Description: This user story ensures that users are promptly informed if a scheduled report fails to generate or deliver due to system errors, data issues, or connectivity problems. The notification should include failure details and suggested next steps, improving transparency and user trust.

- On job failure: Identify users, generate notification, send via preferred method.
- On manual re-run request: Log request, trigger job, update status.

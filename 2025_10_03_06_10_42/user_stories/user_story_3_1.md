EPIC Number: 3
User Story Number: 1
User Story Title: As a traveler, I want to search for available air transport options, so that I can plan and book my journey efficiently.

User Story Description: This user story covers the functionality for travelers to search for available air transport options (flights, charters, etc.) based on origin, destination, date, and preferences. The search should return real-time availability, pricing, and relevant details to help users make informed decisions.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Users can input origin, destination, and travel dates.
2. The system displays a list of available air transport options with details (flight number, airline, departure/arrival times, price).
3. Users can filter and sort results by price, duration, airline, and stops.
4. Search results update in real-time based on availability.
5. Error messages are displayed for invalid or incomplete search criteria.

Validations:
1. Origin and destination fields must not be empty and must be valid locations.
2. Travel date must not be in the past.
3. Returned options must match the search criteria.

Business Logic: 
- Query air transport providersâ€™ APIs for real-time flight data.
- Apply user-specified filters and sorting on the results.
- Validate input fields before querying.
- Handle API errors and display user-friendly messages.

Technical Context: 
- Technology stack: React (frontend), Node.js/Express (backend), PostgreSQL (database).
- Integrate with third-party flight data providers via REST APIs (e.g., Amadeus, Sabre).
- Data format: JSON for API communication.
- Security: HTTPS, input validation, API key management.

Non-Functional Requirements:
- Response time for search queries should be <2 seconds.
- System should be available 99.9% of the time.
- Data must be encrypted in transit.
- Scalable to handle peak search loads.
- Search analytics and monitoring for failed queries.

User Story Title: As a traveler, I want to book and pay for my selected air transport option, so that I can confirm my reservation securely and conveniently.

User Story Description: This user story covers the end-to-end booking and payment process for air transport. Travelers should be able to select a flight, enter passenger details, choose seats, and complete payment using various methods. The system must confirm the booking and provide a receipt and itinerary.

1. Users can select an air transport option from search results.
2. Users can enter passenger and contact details.
3. Users can select seats (if available).
4. Multiple payment options are supported (credit card, PayPal, etc.).
5. Users receive booking confirmation, receipt, and itinerary via email and on the platform.
6. System handles payment failures gracefully and allows retry.

Validations:

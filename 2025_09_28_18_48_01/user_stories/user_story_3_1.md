User Story Title: As a passenger, I want to book an air transport ticket online, So that I can conveniently plan and purchase my travel.

User Story Description: This user story covers the ability for passengers to search for flights, select preferred options, and complete the booking process through an online platform. The system should provide real-time availability, pricing, and confirmation of bookings.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Passengers can search for flights by date, origin, and destination.
2. Available flights are displayed with pricing and seat availability.
3. Passengers can select a flight and proceed to booking.
4. Payment gateway is integrated for secure transactions.
5. Booking confirmation is sent via email/SMS.

Validations:
1. All mandatory fields (date, origin, destination, passenger details) must be filled before proceeding.
2. Payment details must be valid and authorized.
3. Selected seats must be available at the time of booking.

Business Logic: The system should validate user input, check seat availability in real-time, calculate total fare including taxes and fees, and process payment securely. Upon successful payment, the booking is confirmed and a unique booking reference is generated.

Technical Context: The platform will use a web application stack (e.g., React frontend, Node.js backend), integrate with airline APIs for real-time data, and use a secure payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, PayPal). Data will be stored in a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL). All data transmissions must use HTTPS.

Non-Functional Requirements: The system must handle up to 10,000 concurrent users, provide 99.9% uptime, ensure PCI DSS compliance for payment data, and provide real-time monitoring and logging of all transactions.
